# PwrAgent Repository Guidance

## Source of Truth

- UI theme tokens and visual rules are in [docs/UI-THEME.md](docs/UI-THEME.md).
- Desktop UI direction is in [docs/design/desktop-style-guide.md](docs/design/desktop-style-guide.md).
- PwrAgent v2 design references are in [docs/design/pwragent-v2/](docs/design/pwragent-v2/).
  - The bundle contains HTML, CSS, and JSX prototypes.
  - [SOURCE.md](docs/design/pwragent-v2/SOURCE.md) gives the source history and usage policy.
  - Use the bundle as a reference. Do not copy it exactly.
- Operator documentation is in [pwrdrvr/docs.pwragent.ai](https://github.com/pwrdrvr/docs.pwragent.ai).
  - Put platform setup, streaming, webhook, and Settings reference content there.
  - Keep contributor messaging documentation in [this repository](docs/).

## Workflow

- Treat existing brainstorms, plans, and solutions as historical records.
  - The record directories are `docs/brainstorms/`, `docs/plans/`, and `docs/solutions/`.
  - Do not delete or rewrite a record without explicit user authorization.
  - Read a record only for a specific provenance question or an explicit document reference.
  - Use current code, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and package guidance for current behavior and API shape.
- Default `rg` searches exclude brainstorms, plans, and solutions through [`.rgignore`](.rgignore).
  - Use `rg --no-ignore` or `rg -u` only when you need these records.
- Read the [workflow label list](.github/workflows/README.md) before you use a CI-triggering label.
- Exclude `apps/desktop/.local/protocol-captures/` from broad searches.
  - Search that directory only for captured E2E protocol work.

### Command output

- Keep model-visible command output bounded.
- Tool output becomes thread context. Later turns can replay that output.
- For broad discovery, start with `rg -l` or `rg --count-matches`.
- Exclude `__tests__` from discovery unless tests are in scope.
- After discovery, inspect only the files and line ranges that you need.
- Use `rg -n -C` only with a selected file or a small file set.
- Use the minimum context that supports the next decision.
- Give `sed` an explicit file and line range. `sed` does not use an ignore file.
- Do not combine content-producing reads and searches with `&&`.
- The shell sends their combined standard output as one tool result.
- For an intentionally broad scan:
  1. Redirect all output to an ignored `.local/` log.
  2. Report the exact command and its exit state.
  3. Report matching file counts and result counts.
  4. Report failures and warnings.
  5. Return only a bounded tail or the fields needed for the next decision.
- Do not use tool-result truncation as an output budget.

### Codex data boundary

- PwrAgent code must not read Codex-owned storage files.
- Treat Codex session JSONL, rollout files, and SQLite databases as private implementation details.
- Use the Codex App Server protocol for Codex data.
- A feature may read PwrAgent-owned files under `~/.pwragent/`.
- A test may read repository-local fixtures that the test owns.
- CI enforces common violations with `pnpm lint:codex-storage`.
- Do not bypass this check through variable renames or shell commands.
- One module has explicit PwrDrvr LLC authorization for a narrow repair:
  `apps/desktop/src/main/codex-app-server/invalid-response-message-id-recovery.ts`.
  - Repair only rollouts identified by the protocol.
  - Repair only the Responses API invalid message-ID-prefix failure.
  - Create a backup before the repair.
  - Make the repair atomic.
  - Validate the thread before the repair.
  - Remove only invalid `id` fields from response items with type `message`.

### Linux sandbox setup

- Install and desktop dev/preview run an advisory, read-only check of Electron's
  setuid helper. User namespaces may allow launch without that helper.
- From the repository root, use `pnpm check:linux-sandbox` to repeat the check
  and `pnpm fix:linux-sandbox` for the fatal SUID sandbox error.
- The fixer resolves this checkout's installed helper and explicitly uses sudo
  for `chown root:root` followed by `chmod 4755`, then verifies the result.
  It is idempotent; both commands safely no-op on non-Linux platforms.
- Never request sudo automatically during install or launch, run the app as
  root, or disable sandboxing. Reinstalling dependencies or replacing Electron
  may require repeating the repair. Mount/security policy can still block startup.
- Keep a separate `pnpm install` per worktree. Sharing root `node_modules` cannot
  supply package-local links; sharing package `node_modules` can bind workspace
  imports to donor source and make installs/native staging mutate shared files.
  A symlink to a repaired helper inherits permissions but is not a complete fix.

### Desktop test operations

- Use the [desktop E2E fixture seeding skill](.agents/skills/desktop-e2e-fixture-seeding/SKILL.md) for live captured sessions.
- Run desktop E2E from the repository root with `pnpm test:desktop-e2e`.
- The package command `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop test:e2e` is also safe.
- Both commands build `apps/desktop/out/` before Playwright starts.
- For PwrSuiteLab macOS Tart, runner, or headed E2E work, follow
  `.agents/skills/macos-vm-e2e-lab/SKILL.md`. It uses PwrSuiteLab Control MCP's
  current schemas and served skills when connected. Use the
  managed-controller fallback only when MCP is unavailable, preserving existing
  scoped authorizations. Do not provision a product-local Tart lab or improvise
  direct Tart or SSH access from this repository.
- For PwrSuiteLab Windows probes or headed E2E, read
  `.agents/skills/use-windows-vm-lab/SKILL.md` in the attached lab checkout.
  Do not use the macOS VM skill for Windows work.
- Review the current ownership and readiness constraints before you change:
  - Windows Git or Bash process launch and shutdown.
  - Vitest process isolation.
  - Queue or composer lifecycle tests.
  - Lazy renderer readiness.
- Git-for-Windows launcher handoffs have caused expensive Windows-only failures.
- Non-atomic descendant cleanup has caused expensive Windows-only failures.
- Optimistic renderer synchronization has caused expensive Windows-only failures.
- Do not substitute retries, longer timeouts, fewer workers, or serial lanes for an ownership fix.
- Do not substitute those workarounds for an evidence-based readiness fix.
- The macOS CI lane uses the selected-repository **PwrDrvr macOS** runner group.
- Only PwrAgent and PwrSnap share this group.
- Do not add a repository-scoped runner.
- Do not give the full organization access to this group.
- For branch-drift dialog screenshots, run `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop inspect:e2e:branch-drift`.
- This command opens a replay-backed Electron fixture.
- Close the application to end the command.
- For README screenshots, run `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop screenshot:readme`.
- The README screenshot command writes files under `docs/assets/screenshots/`.
- Read "Capturing README Screenshots" in [apps/desktop/AGENTS.md](apps/desktop/AGENTS.md) for the complete procedure.
- That procedure identifies the specification, fixtures, state helpers, and native capture tools.
- The terminal or IDE that runs the screenshot test needs macOS Screen Recording permission.
- To focus root Vitest, pass file paths or filters directly to `pnpm test`.
- For example, run `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/backend-registry.test.ts`.
- Do not put a standalone `--` before the focus arguments.
- The command `pnpm test -- apps/...` runs the full workspace suite.

### SQLite write budgets

- Measure a new SQLite write if it runs at any of these frequencies:
  - Per command.
  - Per turn.
  - Per item.
  - Per streamed event.
  - On a timer.
- Add a checked-in write budget that fails when the write count changes.
- Calculate the write cost as writes per second × commit cost × session duration.
- Report the projected cost in MB per day.
- Count SQLite commits, not statements.
- Each implicit transaction flushes dirty pages and all changed index pages.
- A SQLite page is approximately 4 KB.
- An indexed timestamp can move one index entry during each write.
- Use these calibration results:
  - PR #1406 wrote once for each streamed 8 KiB chunk.
  - One `find /` caused 3,693 commits and 58 MB of WAL.
  - Former 10-second runtime lease heartbeats caused 720 commits each hour.
  - Those heartbeats wrote 2.7 MB each hour for each running instance.
  - That rate was approximately 65 MB each day.
  - PID-owned runtime leases now make no SQLite commits while idle.
- If the projection is excessive, report it to the user.
- Do not quietly ship an excessive projection.
- Ask the user to select a different design constraint.
- Possible designs include one transaction, a flush window, or boundary-based persistence.
- The correct design can also be no persistence.
- Write budgets are in `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/fixtures/sqlite-write-budgets.json`.
- Wrap the feature, not its setup, with `measureSqliteWrites`.
- Record a budget with `UPDATE_SQLITE_WRITE_BUDGETS=1`.
- Keep each write-cost change visible as one reviewable diff line.
- Survey a full run with `pnpm test:sqlite-writes`.
- Read "Sqlite Write-Volume Instrumentation" in [apps/desktop/AGENTS.md](apps/desktop/AGENTS.md).

## Code Formatting & Linting

- Use ESLint only as a correctness linter.
- Run `pnpm lint:eslint`.
- The CI `Lint` job also runs these checks:
  - `lint:sql`.
  - `lint:codex-storage`.
  - `lint:colors`.
  - `licenses:check`.
  - `typecheck`.
  - `lint:boundaries`.
- [`eslint.config.mjs`](eslint.config.mjs) enables the recommended TypeScript ESLint rules.
- The renderer also uses the classic React Hooks rules.
- The ESLint configuration has no style rules.
- Fix all ESLint errors.
- ESLint sets existing `no-explicit-any`, `exhaustive-deps`, and intentional patterns to `warn`.
- CI blocks errors. CI does not block warnings.
- Do not add style or whitespace rules to ESLint.
- Do not use `eslint --fix` to format code.

### Unused imports and locals fail CI

- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` is `"error"`, not `"warn"`.
- `pnpm lint:eslint` is the command that fails.
- CI runs it as the `ESLint` step of the `Lint` job in
  [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
- `pnpm build` does not catch this. It is `electron-vite build`, which
  strips types through Vite and Rollup without checking them.
- The rule exists for one defect: a refactor moves code out of a file and
  leaves its imports behind.
- As a warning the rule printed a line nobody had to act on. Neither ESLint
  invocation passes `--max-warnings 0`.
- The escape hatch is an underscore prefix.
- Under this configuration `_x` silences an unused import, local, type alias,
  interface, enum, class, parameter, and caught error.
- Before you delete an unused binding, ask what it was for.
- An unused binding is sometimes a missing call or a missing assertion.
- The rule does not see three things. Check each by hand:
  - A leading unused parameter. `args` defaults to `after-used`, so the rule
    reports only a trailing one.
  - An unused class member, including a `private readonly` constructor
    parameter property.
  - An export whose last importer you just removed. Grep for the symbol.

#### What the ESLint globs reach

- `lint:eslint:cached` runs over `packages/**/*.{ts,tsx}`,
  `apps/*/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, and root-level `*.ts`.
- That reaches `apps/desktop/e2e/`, `apps/desktop/scripts/`,
  `apps/desktop/eval/`, the `apps/desktop/*.config.ts` files, and
  `vitest.workspace.ts`.
- No `.mjs` file is linted anywhere, including the build and CI scripts under
  `scripts/`.
- `lint:eslint:typed` stays on `apps/*/src/**` and `packages/**`.
- Its own configuration matches no other path, so widening its globs would
  lint files against no rules.

#### Why this gate is not `noUnusedLocals`

- `tsconfig.base.json` sets neither `noUnusedLocals` nor `noUnusedParameters`.
- TypeScript's underscore exemption is narrower than ESLint's.
- Measured against this repository: `_x` silences an unused import and an
  unused parameter, and does **not** silence an unused local or an unused type
  alias.
- Enabling both flags would reject the existing `_`-prefixed intentionally
  unused locals and would cost 27 fixes, measured on the current tree.
- Fifteen of those 27 are parameter renames in the Star Map cluster tests.
- The flags would add the first two hand checks listed above: a leading
  unused parameter, and an unused class member.
- They would not add the third. No tool here reports an unused export.

### Formatting

- The repository intentionally has no automatic formatter.
- Format code by hand.
- Prettier is not a dependency.
- The repository has no `.prettierrc`, `format` script, or CI formatting step.
- Never run `npx prettier`, `npx prettier --write`, or `prettier --write` on repository files.
- Without a local dependency, `npx` downloads Prettier and uses its default configuration.
- Those defaults conflict with the hand-maintained repository style.
- The defaults also reformat unchanged code.
- In PR #934, Prettier changed approximately 90 unrelated lines around a three-line change.
- Those changes made the diff larger and reduced the value of `git blame`.
- A full repository test changed approximately 77% of files.
- The project rejected that full repository reformat.
- Do not introduce an isolated Prettier reformat.
- Inspect adjacent code before you format new code.
- Use these local style rules:
  - Double quotes.
  - Two-space indentation.
  - Semicolons.
  - Trailing commas in multiline literals.
  - Leading binary operators in wrapped expressions.
- Put a wrapped binary operator at the start of the continuation line:

  ```ts
  const ok =
    isAllowed(char)
    || SAFE_PUNCTUATION.has(char)
    || isDigit(char);
  ```

- Prettier puts these operators at the end of the prior line.
- The repository contains more than 500 leading-operator lines.
- Make new code match adjacent code.
- Keep each diff limited to the requested change.
- If a file has unrelated inconsistencies, do not change those lines.

## Agent Instruction Files

- Put a `CLAUDE.md` symlink next to each `AGENTS.md` file.
- Point each symlink to its sibling `AGENTS.md` file.
- This structure gives Codex and Claude the same local guidance.

## Pull Requests

- Use Conventional Commit-style PR titles: `type(scope): short description`.
- Select the scope that matches the changed area:
  - Use `messaging` for Telegram, Discord, adapters, and messaging integrations.
  - Use `desktop` for the desktop application.
  - Use `agent-core` for coding-agent backends and ACP integration.
  - Use `release` for packaging, signing, notarization, distribution, and automatic updates.
  - Use `docs` for documentation.
  - Use `tests` for test coverage, fixtures, and test infrastructure.
- Prefer before/after screenshots on PRs that change visible UI.
  - Use 100% contrived fixture data when possible.
  - If a screenshot is not 100% contrived, show it to the operator and wait for approval before attaching. Redact anything that must not ship (secrets, tokens, customer data, private thread text, account identifiers).
- GitHub CLI 2.99+ (`gh` v2.99.0) can attach images and videos with the repeatable `--attach` flag on `gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`, and `gh pr comment`.
  - Reference the local path in the Markdown body so `gh` rewrites it to the uploaded URL in place. Unreferenced attachments are appended at the end.
  - Example:

    ```bash
    gh pr create \
      --title "fix(desktop): tighten composer padding" \
      --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md \
      --attach ./before.png \
      --attach ./after.png
    ```

    With this body:

    ```markdown
    ## Before
    ![composer before](./before.png)

    ## After
    ![composer after](./after.png)
    ```

  - Alt text can also follow the path after `#`, as in `--attach './after.png#composer after'`. Update `gh` to v2.99.0 or later before using `--attach`.
  - `gh` rewrites a link only when its target equals an `--attach` path byte-for-byte. The `#alt` suffix is not compared. On a mismatch, `gh` appends the upload at the end instead.
  - The rewrite exists only in the uploaded body. The local body file keeps the local paths.
  - For every later body edit, run `gh pr view <n> --json body -q .body > <file>` and edit that copy. Never re-send the original draft. It replaces the live `user-attachments` URLs with dead local paths.
  - To add an image later, pass `--attach` for the new file only. Existing `user-attachments` URLs match no `--attach` path, so `gh` leaves them alone.
  - `gh` exits 0 in each of these cases. Verify that every body image link is a `user-attachments` URL, and that each asset fetches with HTTP 200 and the local file's byte count.

## Release / Distribution

- Read the [desktop release runbook](docs/desktop-release-runbook.md) for release procedures.
- The runbook covers packaging, signing, notarization, publishing, and automatic updates.
- PwrAgent uses the MIT license. PwrDrvr LLC owns the project.
- Preserve the repository `LICENSE` file.
- Preserve each package `license: "MIT"` declaration.
- Preserve the third-party license report.
- Do not change the first-party license without an explicit PwrDrvr LLC policy change.
- Do not remove license disclosures without an explicit PwrDrvr LLC policy change.

### macOS app icon — ship the Icon Composer `.icon`; actool derives the `.icns`

- `mac.icon` in `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml` points at `build/icon.icon`, an Icon Composer package, and nothing in this repo hand-builds a `.icns`. electron-builder (26.15+, pinned) compiles it with Xcode 26's `actool` into `Contents/Resources/Assets.car` + `CFBundleIconName` (what macOS 26 draws) and derives the legacy `Contents/Resources/icon.icns` + `CFBundleIconFile` (macOS 15 and earlier) from the same source. Each OS reads the format designed for it.
- Why this is an invariant: macOS 26 auto-normalizes a legacy `.icns` it is handed *instead of* a `.icon`, and how it does so changed between 26.6.1 and 26.6.2. A `.icns` padded to Apple's 824-in-1024 template (#1918 here — the right shape for macOS 15) came out on a light plate in the Dock, Finder, and the DMG window on 26.6.2 for PwrSnap and PwrGit. With the `.icon` present the `.icns` is never opened on macOS 26. Ghostty (MIT) ships exactly this pair.
- Regenerate with `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop generate:macos-app-icon`. `build/icon.png` — the 512px full-bleed master, also shipped as the `pwragent-app-icon.png` resource and used as the Windows/Linux source — stays the authored artwork. The script derives `build/icon.icon/` (the mark drawn from the geometry of `docs/design/pwragent-v2/project/assets/logo-pwragnt.svg` as a transparent, antialiased layer — the master is measured against that geometry first, so a re-export that no longer matches fails the script; the tile gradient is the package `fill`) and `build/icon-macos.png` (padded — the development Dock icon `src/main/index.ts` paints literally before macOS 26) from it. Then run `generate:themed-dock-icons`, which renders the macOS 26 development icon and the themed Dock icons from those outputs. Do not add a `.icns` back, and do not point `mac.icon` at one.
- A themed Dock icon (`src/main/themed-dock-icon.ts`) follows the color theme on screen (a dark tile per dark theme, a light tile per light theme; Tangerine in either scheme keeps the app's own icon) and is a runtime `app.dock.setIcon()` bitmap, and macOS 26 applies Liquid Glass only to the bundle's `.icon`, so the glass is baked in: `build/dock-icons/glass/<theme>.png` (Darwin 25+) beside the flat `build/dock-icons/<theme>.png` (macOS 15 and earlier), and the development build, which has no bundle icon, paints `build/icon-macos-glass.png` on Darwin 25+ instead of `build/icon-macos.png`. `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop generate:themed-dock-icons` writes the glass and flat sets by compiling a recolored copy of `build/icon.icon` with actool and rendering it through `NSWorkspace`, which draws in the Mac's current icon style; it needs macOS 26, actool 26, the Default icon style, and Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast off, and refuses otherwise. AppKit has no alternate-icon API (Apple confirmed it on the developer forums in June 2026), so per-instance icons cannot use the system's own glass.
- Every job that packages the mac app needs an actool 26 or newer; electron-builder hard-fails below that, and GitHub's `macos-15` image defaults to Xcode 16.4. `.github/actions/select-xcode-for-actool` finds the newest stable Xcode with actool 26+ and returns its Developer directory; `release.yml` (both macOS jobs) and `preview-build.yml` set `DEVELOPER_DIR` from it on exactly the steps that run actool — the unit tests, so the compile test in `apps/desktop/scripts/app-icon.test.mjs` runs instead of skips (that step also sets `PWRAGENT_REQUIRE_ACTOOL=1`, so on the release lane the suite fails rather than skips when the probe finds no actool 26) — and electron-builder, so the icon compile does not move `build:native:dock` (the Dock tile plug-in, built with `xcrun clang`) onto a different SDK. The sign job has no checkout, so the action rides inside the archived signing input. Locally, select an Xcode 26 (`xcode-select`, or `DEVELOPER_DIR`) before `package:dryrun`.
- The compile test calls electron-builder's own helper (`app-builder-lib/out/util/macosIconComposer.generateAssetCatalogForIcon`), not a copied actool command line, so the two cannot drift.
- actool's derived `.icns` carries 16, 32, 128 and 256px reps only, the same four Ghostty ships. macOS 15 upsamples the 256px rep for Finder's largest icon sizes and Quick Look, where the deleted hand-built icns had 512 and 1024. Accepted for now; an `afterPack` hook could splice larger reps rendered from `icon-macos.png` if it ever matters.
- `actool` resolves `--app-icon Icon` by the package basename. Fed `build/icon.icon` directly it exits 0 and silently writes no `.icns`. electron-builder copies the package to `Icon.icon` first; do the same if you compile by hand, and check the output for the `.icns`.
- Verify an icon change by rendering `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` on the newest macOS you ship to and measuring the opaque bounds. The recipe, measurements, and the Ghostty comparison are in PwrSnap's `docs/solutions/2026-09-05-macos-26-legacy-icon-light-plate.md` (pwrdrvr/PwrSnap#563). A clean result on an older point release or on the GitHub runner proves nothing for this class.

### Third-party dependency licenses

- Three scripts cover licensing. They check different things.

| Script | Checks |
|---|---|
| [`check-package-licenses.mjs`](scripts/check-package-licenses.mjs) | Our own workspace `package.json` files declare MIT. Never looks at a dependency. |
| [`check-third-party-license-allowlist.mjs`](scripts/check-third-party-license-allowlist.mjs) | Every declared license the notice covers is on an allowlist. |
| [`generate-third-party-licenses.mjs`](scripts/generate-third-party-licenses.mjs) | Transcribes the tree into `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`. Judges nothing. |

- That last row is the reason the allowlist gate exists.
- The generator groups records by whatever license string pnpm reports.
- Before the gate, a dependency that flipped MIT to GPL-3.0 wrote a new `GPL-3.0` section into the notice.
- `generate-third-party-licenses.mjs --check` then passed, because the committed file matched the generated file.
- CI went green and shipped copyleft.
- The only safety was that a reviewer might notice a new license heading in the diff.
- `pnpm licenses:check` runs the allowlist gate before the notice check.
- A bad license then reports as a licensing problem, not as a stale notice.
- Run the gate alone with `pnpm licenses:allowlist`.
- The gate evaluates each declared license as an SPDX expression, not as a string match.
- `OR` is satisfied by either side. `(MIT OR WTFPL)` passes on its MIT half, so WTFPL needs no allowlist entry.
- `AND` requires both sides. `Apache-2.0 AND GPL-3.0` fails.
- `AND` binds tighter than `OR`.
- Identifier comparison folds case, because SPDX short identifiers are case-insensitive.
- An unparseable string fails. Examples are `UNLICENSED`, `SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE.md`, and a `WITH` exception.
- Refusing to guess is the safe direction for a legal gate.

#### Gate coverage

- The gate covers the records the notice is built from.
- It reads the npm production tree for the `@pwragent/desktop...` pnpm selector.
- The `...` suffix is load-bearing. Keep it.
- A bare `@pwragent/desktop` selects that one project.
- `pnpm licenses list` then reports only the dependencies that `apps/desktop/package.json` declares.
- Every dependency reached through a workspace package is invisible to that selector.
- `@pwragent/desktop` depends on eight workspace packages.
- The whole npm tree under the six messaging providers ships in the packaged application.
- Before the suffix, 69 shipped packages were absent from the notice and ungated.
- `NOTICE_PNPM_FILTER` in [`generate-third-party-licenses.mjs`](scripts/generate-third-party-licenses.mjs) holds this selector.
- The generator and the gate import that one constant, so the two cannot drift.
- A test asserts the exact selector string, because dropping the suffix leaves every check passing.
- It reads `NOTICE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` from the `all` report.
- That set holds Electron, a devDependency that ships and that `--prod` never reports.
- The generator and the gate import that one set, so the two cannot drift.
- Add a name to `NOTICE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` when a devDependency starts shipping.
- The synthesized platform variants copy `declaredLicense` from their parent record.
- Gating the production tree therefore gates them.
- The gate reports a failure when a surface produced no records at all.
- An empty report is otherwise indistinguishable from a clean tree.
- The gate does **not** cover these sources:
  - Optional dependencies that the running machine did not install. The generator does not pass `--no-optional`, and the CI `Lint` job runs on `ubuntu-latest` only.
  - A platform variant's own package metadata. The notice prints the parent's license for every variant, so neither script ever reads one.
  - devDependencies outside `NOTICE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES`. They do not ship and the notice does not disclose them.
  - Chromium and Node.js components inside Electron. The notice points at Electron's upstream generated credits.
  - Codex App Server Rust crates. PwrAgent invokes a locally installed Codex App Server and vendors no crate.

#### Changing the allowlist

- Adding an id to `ALLOWED_LICENSE_IDS` is a legal decision.
- Make that decision in a commit that says why.
- Never add an id to make CI green.
- PwrDrvr LLC explicitly approved one exception on 2026-09-20: ship Dugite's
  bundled Git as a separate executable with Git LFS, to remove the system-Git
  dependency. Git's GPL-2.0-only license and source/build locations are retained
  in `apps/desktop/resources/embedded-git/` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`. This does
  not add GPL to the npm dependency allowlist or change first-party MIT licensing.
- Apart from that bundled Git exception, strong copyleft and source-available terms are permitted nowhere.
- Those terms include GPL, AGPL, BSL, SSPL, and Commons Clause.
- PwrDrvr LLC approved a scoped AppImage exception on 2026-10-01, to permit
  the modern runtime without a system `libfuse.so.2` dependency.
  - Permit only the unmodified AppImage `type2-runtime` release `20251108`
    (commit `dd6cebedcbddde9c82f89b011e8e1d40b6e43868`), as distributed by
    electron-builder's `toolsets.appimage: "1.0.3"`, as the AppImage ELF stub.
  - This exception covers its statically linked libfuse 3.15.0 library under
    LGPL-2.1-only. It does not cover LGPL libraries in the Electron payload,
    native addons, or npm dependencies, or bundled `fusermount`/`fusermount3`
    executables. A different runtime or library version needs a new decision.
  - Keep first-party code and package declarations MIT. Do not add LGPL to
    `ALLOWED_LICENSE_IDS`.
  - Before shipping an AppImage, retain the runtime's MIT notice, full LGPL-2.1
    text, libfuse's license split, and all linked-library notices in the
    distribution and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`. Include mimalloc's MIT notice and
    use libzstd's BSD license alternative.
  - Publish the complete pinned runtime and library source, patches, checksums,
    and build/relink instructions beside the AppImage on the same GitHub
    release. Preserve original source and identify modifications with dated
    change notices, including the upstream libfuse `mount.c` patch.
  - Identify the runtime stub and the separately executed Electron payload in
    the notice. State that `fusermount`/`fusermount3` is a system executable,
    not included in the AppImage.
- LGPL remains prohibited outside that AppImage runtime exception. The
  exception records approval; it does not itself add a shipped component or
  satisfy the required disclosures and source distribution.
- `MPL-2.0` is the one copyleft id on the allowlist.
- Its copyleft binds the MPL-licensed files themselves.
- It places no condition on the larger work that includes them.
- Do not read that entry as permission for file-scoped copyleft in general.
- PwrDrvr LLC approved `OFL-1.1` on 2026-09-29, on the condition that PwrGit
  and PwrSnap already ship it. Both bundle `@fontsource/geist-sans` and
  `@fontsource/geist-mono` under it.
- `OFL-1.1` covers the Geist webfont assets that the renderer build emits.
- Its copyleft binds a derived font, which must stay under the OFL.
- It places no condition on software that embeds the font.
- The seeded list records drift that existed before any policy was enforced.
- `BlueOak-1.0.0` and `Python-2.0` were already in the shipped tree and documented nowhere.
- `0BSD`, `CC0-1.0`, `MPL-2.0`, and `Unlicense` are approved ids that the production tree does not use today.

## Runtime Configuration

- Store all desktop configuration and state under `~/.pwragent/`.
- This directory is the **PwrAgent root**.
- For isolated E2E or development work, override the root with `PWRAGENT_HOME=/path/to/root`.
- Select a named profile with `PWRAGENT_PROFILE=<name>`.
- If the variable is not set, use the `default` profile.
- Store profile settings in `~/.pwragent/profiles/<name>/config.toml`.
- Store profile state in `~/.pwragent/profiles/<name>/state/state.db`.
- Before an incompatible TOML shape change, read [config-file-evolution.md](docs/config-file-evolution.md).
- Apply all of these configuration evolution rules:
  - Read fallback.
  - Lazy conversion.
  - Legacy comment.
  - Dual write.
- Do not use `PWRAGNT_STATE_ROOT` or `PWRAGNT_CONFIG_PATH`.
- The application does not read those removed variables.
- Multiple instances can safely share one profile database through SQLite WAL mode.
- Do not add a lock file for this database.

### Dev-only env vars

These variables are for development only.

- A build is packaged when `app.isPackaged === true`.
- Production operators must not set these variables.
- A packaged build ignores each variable.
- If a packaged build finds one, startup writes a `mainLog.error` entry.
- The packaged build then treats the variable as unset.

`PWRAGENT_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE=1`

- Skip the onboarding prompt when a named profile does not exist.
- Use this variable for E2E fixtures and replay harnesses that need a profile directory.
- Production launches must use the onboarding wizard.
- The wizard prevents an unrequested mapping to a Codex authentication profile.
- Issue #524 explains this requirement.

`PWRAGENT_DEV_DISABLE_SECRET_STORAGE=1`

- Skip all `safeStorage` operations.
- The wizard silently discards secrets that the operator enters.
- Secret pills on the Settings screen report `unavailable`.
- Use this workaround only for unsigned development builds on macOS.
- Those builds can show a `Keychain Not Found` dialog because they have no stable signing identity.
- Signed release builds do not have this problem.
- After development, enter the secrets again in **Settings → Models** on a signed build.

`PWRAGENT_DEV_SQLITE_WRITE_METRICS=1`

- Count process-level SQLite commits, statements, rows, WAL growth, and table activity.
- `StateDb.open` installs the metrics wrapper after schema setup.
- Set `PWRAGENT_DEV_SQLITE_WRITE_METRICS_FILE=<path>` to select an output file.
- The metrics file gets one JSON line of totals for each source.
- Read "Sqlite Write-Volume Instrumentation" in [apps/desktop/AGENTS.md](apps/desktop/AGENTS.md).

`PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS=1`

- Load the standalone React DevTools backend as the renderer's first `<head>` script.
- `PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS_HOST` and `PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS_PORT` select the endpoint.
- Default the endpoint to `localhost:8097`.
- Give each checkout its own port when profiling more than one at a time.
- This variable is read by [electron.vite.config.ts](apps/desktop/electron.vite.config.ts) at build time, not by the app process.
- A build made with this variable set must never ship.
- `verify-asar-contents.mjs` fails packaging when renderer HTML loads a remote script.

`PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_PROFILING=1`

- Alias `react-dom/client` to `react-dom/profiling` for `electron-vite build`.
- Use this variable only when an absolute millisecond number must be trustworthy.
- The dev server already serves a profilable `react-dom`, so this variable is a no-op there.
- Use the dev build to find re-render storms. It carries richer render attribution.
- Read "Profiling the Renderer with React DevTools" in [apps/desktop/AGENTS.md](apps/desktop/AGENTS.md).

`PWRAGENT_DEV_FAKE_UPDATE=1`

- Walk a fake update check instead of answering `skipped` in development.
- Real auto-update runs in packaged builds only, so this is the only way to
  see the update progress card, its byte meter, and Cancel without cutting a
  release.
- The fake applies to operator-initiated checks only. Startup and periodic
  checks still answer `skipped`, so an opted-in dev launch raises nothing on
  its own.
- The offered version is `420.0.0`. Restart declines it; nothing was
  downloaded to install.
- Set `PWRAGENT_DEV_FAKE_UPDATE_STEP_MS=<ms>` to pace the walk. The default is
  300 ms per step. `e2e/update-check.spec.ts` slows it so the mid-download
  Cancel button is a target rather than a race.
- Read the [update feature guidance](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/features/update/AGENTS.md)
  for why the fake is opt-in here and not in PwrGit.

## Frontend and Desktop UI

- Before renderer UI work, read the [desktop style guide](docs/design/desktop-style-guide.md).
- Before color or theme work, read the [UI theme guide](docs/UI-THEME.md).
- Use existing theme tokens before you add local CSS.
- Prefer a thread-first information hierarchy to a generic dashboard layout.
- Do not put scaffold narration in the user interface.
- Do not put placeholder implementation text in the user interface.

### Reuse existing chrome tokens

Before you build new window chrome, open `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/app.css`.

- Find the existing primitive that has the same function.
- Copy its token references.
- Do not select a different token because it looks similar.
- Keep brand presentation identical in all windows.

This rule applies to these elements:

- Title-bar strips.
- Brand marks.
- Breadcrumbs.
- Eyebrows.
- Path or application rows.

Canonical primitives and the tokens they read:

| Primitive | Mark | Brand | Brand accent | Eyebrow | Breadcrumb separator | Breadcrumb current |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.sidebar__brand` (main sidebar) | `--accent` | `--text-primary` | `--accent` | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| `.settings-nav__brand` (Settings nav) | `--accent` | `--text-primary` | `--accent` | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| `.settings-titlebar__*` (Settings right-pane) | n/a | n/a | n/a | `--accent` | `--text-muted` | `--text-primary` |
| `.activity-titlebar__*` (Activity window) | `--accent` | `--text-primary` | `--accent` | `--accent` | `--text-muted` | `--text-primary` |

Render a brand through `BrandLockup`
(`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/features/chrome/BrandLockup.tsx`).

- It draws the app-icon mark and the wordmark together.
- Do not hand-write a `__brand` paragraph. The lockup's test fails when one appears.
- The macOS title-strip geometry is the Pwr-family spec in
  [features/chrome/AGENTS.md](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/features/chrome/AGENTS.md).

`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/__tests__/theme-contract.test.tsx` enforces this token contract.

- The test compares brand accent tokens across the listed primitives.
- The test holds the lockup's mark color, gap, and wordmark type to the family spec.
- The test also compares Activity and Settings breadcrumb tokens.
- If you intentionally change a chrome token, change the test in the same commit.
- This paired change makes the design decision visible during review.

## Current Product Direction

### Thread model and lenses

- Threads are first-class and may exist without a directory.
- Attention, Drafts, Inbox, Recents, and Directories use one thread lens switch.
- Each lens tab contains only an icon or status indicators.
- Put the lens name in the `aria-label` and tooltip.
- A thread can have links to multiple Git directories.

### Attention lens

- Use Attention as the work queue.
- Include threads with a live turn.
- Include threads that wait for review.
- Use two count indicators instead of a tab icon:
  - A scanner for turns in progress.
  - An orange cookie for unread threads.
- Show zero for each empty count.
- Make an indicator grey when its count is zero.
- Do not hide a zero indicator. A missing indicator makes an idle tab appear broken.

### Attention order

- Order Attention by turn, not by activity.
- All other lenses use a pure `updatedAt` or `createdAt` sort.
- Do not use `updatedAt` to order Attention.
- `updatedAt` changes for each streamed item, subagent call, and tool result.
- Activity ordering would move queue items while the operator uses the queue.
- Give each Attention member a rank when its turn starts.
- Keep that rank for the complete turn.
- A thread can move at most twice during one turn.
- The optional second move occurs when the turn ends.
- `general.attention_promote_on_turn_end` controls that move and defaults to on.
- When enabled, move a finished turn to the top for review.
- Apply this promotion to a turn that the current window observed.
- Also apply it to a turn that starts and finishes between polls.
- Messaging and peer-driven turns can use this case.
- For that case, treat an idle member with a newer `updatedAt` as a finished turn.
- Never use this detection path for a live turn.
- Use a monotonic counter for ranks. Do not use a clock.
- Do not call `Date.now()` from the render path.
- Do not create rank ties.
- Scope ranks to current Attention membership.
- If a thread leaves and returns, give it a new rank at the top.
- The reducer and design rationale are in [attention-order.ts](apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/features/navigation/attention-order.ts).

### Drafts lens

- Drafts is the second state lens.
- Use Drafts for threads that contain unsent composer text.
- Sort Drafts by recent activity.
- Store a draft on the machine where the operator writes it.
- Store the latest draft in `composer_draft_latest`.
- Restore that draft during the next application launch.
- Never federate draft text.
- A viewer can draft a reply to a thread from a peer instance.
- Show the Draft chip only to that viewer.
- Do not show that draft to the instance that owns the thread.
- This rule prevents publication of an operator's unsent text.
- Show the Draft chip in every lens.
- The current implementation has two intentional limits:
  - Draft storage is machine-wide, but each window reads it only during mount.
  - A second window does not update its Draft chips until it restarts.
  - Launchpad composer text has no thread row.
  - Therefore, the lens label uses `replies`.
  - Its empty state is `No unsent replies.`

### Inbox, Recents, and Directories

- Use Inbox as the default browsing lens.
- Sort Inbox by recent activity.
- Show all threads in Inbox.
- Sort Recents by thread creation time.
- Show all threads in Recents.
- This creation-time order prevents active threads from moving.
- Keep Inbox and Recents as pure sort orders.
- Do not create a pinned section in those lenses.
- In Inbox, show each pinned thread at its normal `updatedAt` position.
- In Recents, show each pinned thread at its normal `createdAt` position.
- Offer visible pin ordering only in Directories.
- The pin-order controls are:
  - Drag.
  - The `⌘⇧↑` and `⌘⇧↓` shortcuts.
  - **Move Up** and **Move Down** in the context menu.
- Within each directory, show pinned threads first.
- Pins have two tiers: pins kept at top, then ordinary pins.
  - The tier lives in the rank: kept pins use a band below
    `KEEP_AT_TOP_RANK_BOUNDARY` in `packages/shared/src/thread-pins.ts`.
    Every rank sort, store, and federation hop already orders it first.
  - A new pin, including an auto-pinned new thread, lands at the top of the
    ordinary pins and never above a kept pin.
  - Cross tiers only explicitly: the **Keep at Top** check item in the
    context menu, or a drag. Move Up, Move Down, and the shortcuts stay
    inside the pin's tier.
  - A pin drag shows a ghost Keep at top slot: above the pins while no pin
    is kept, else below the last kept pin. Only a drop inside the slot's own
    box keeps. The slot must not overlap a row.
  - A drop on a pin row adopts that row's tier. The line above the first
    ordinary pin is the top of the ordinary pins; the lower half of the
    last kept pin is the end of the kept pins.
  - The **Pinned** and **Keep at Top** check items toggle in place and keep
    the menu open. Return or a click outside closes it.
- Sort unpinned directory threads by thread creation time.

### Unread behavior

- Show unread state as an orange cookie on thread rows in every lens.
- In all lenses except Attention, clear unread state when the thread gets focus.
- In Attention, keep unread state when the thread gets focus.
- In Attention, clear unread state only after the operator sends a reply.
- The composer reports accepted sends and steers through `onUserRepliedToThread`.
- That callback calls `markThreadsSeen`.
- Do not apply reply-only clearing to other lenses.
- A global rule would leave read threads unread when the operator does not reply.
- Keep normal focus-based clearing in ordinary browsing lenses.
- Skip `retainedUnreadThread` in Attention.
- That mechanism normally clears a retained thread when the operator leaves it.
- Apply the exemption to the Attention lens, not to a thread.
- If the operator leaves Attention, clear the selected thread's unread state.
- This rule applies when the selected thread remains selected in the next lens.
- Tests in `useThreadNavigation.test.tsx` enforce both parts of this transition.

### Reply acceptance

- Report a reply only after the backend accepts it.
- Do not report a reply when the operator only attempts it.
- Call `onUserRepliedToThread` only after `startTurn` or `steerTurn` resolves.
- Apply the same rule when `useQueuedTurnRelease` sends a queued turn.
- If the send fails, keep the thread in Attention.
- Early reporting would remove a thread for a message that never left the machine.

## Dependency Boundary Enforcement

Never weaken the dependency boundary rules.

- `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` defines the layered architecture.
- `dependency-cruiser` reads this configuration.
- Do not add an exception or allowlist to that file.
- Do not add a `severity: "ignore"` override.
- Do not import from a package above the current package layer.
- Do not introduce a circular dependency.
- Do not move code to bypass a boundary.
- Do not restructure code to bypass a boundary.
- If a boundary blocks a change, redesign the change.

Use this dependency order from lowest to highest:

- `packages/shared` imports no internal package.
- `packages/messaging/interface` imports only `packages/shared`.
- `packages/messaging/providers/*` imports only `packages/messaging/interface`.
- `apps/desktop` can import any package.

The renderer has an additional boundary.

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/` can import only `@pwragent/shared` directly.
- Access every other package through the main-process IPC bridge.
- Run `pnpm lint:boundaries` before you push.
- CI fails for every boundary violation.
