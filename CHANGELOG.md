## v1.1.0-alpha.3 - 2026-09-06

- GPT-6 Astra - Added GPT-6 Astra as a selectable provider model, with correct context-window pricing for multi-request turns.
- Cross-Platform Updates - Fixed Windows and Linux updater-channel metadata publication, and made installed builds follow their own release feed while clearly showing all Stable/Beta and Latest/Prerelease slots.
- Federation - Added a network activity monitor and streamed federated jump-search results, making remote-thread discovery more visible and responsive while hardening remote-owner searches and reconnection behavior.
- macOS Appearance - Added the modern Icon Composer app-icon format, keeping PwrAgent's icon correct on macOS 26 while preserving the legacy icon path for older macOS versions.
- Performance - Reduced background work by retaining directory mappings until the filesystem changes, loading the PDF runtime only on demand, and bounding Token Miser storage and accounting reads with temporary original-output retention. Added sustained main-process CPU visibility for diagnosis.
- Thread Reliability - Kept the composer available during thread setup, held queued actions after provider failures, retained live review cards through delayed refreshes, and preserved cross-thread message content and provenance.
- Usage and Pricing - Added Luna Reserve and Codex credit-balance visibility, refreshed Codex usage limits, surfaced retry and connection warnings, and preserved pricing for failed turns.
- GitHub Operations - Backed off polling after outages while recovering on reconnect, and stopped repeated pull-request auto-fixer dispatch decisions from creating unnecessary activity.

## v1.1.0-alpha.1 - 2026-08-20

This is the first 1.1 release, and it is an alpha on the Beta channel's
Prerelease track. It carries every fix shipped in 1.0.1 through 1.0.3,
including signed Windows installers and Linux DEB packages.

- Secure Federation - Added profile-to-profile federation so separate PwrAgent instances can see and drive each other's work. Enrolled identities are exchanged over a Noise-encrypted control channel, with local, Tailscale Serve/Funnel, Cloudflare Tunnel, and SSH transports, multi-path gateway endpoints, and optional Access-token and mTLS edge controls.
- Remote Threads and Terminals - Federated threads can be mounted, pinned, and opened in reusable remote viewer windows, with live transcript, image, and pull-request synchronization, nested child threads across instances, integrated remote terminals over a relayed PTY, and one unified Cmd/Ctrl+K search across every connected instance.
- Star Map - Added the full-screen Star Map mission-control surface for local and remote work. Threads orbit as cards in orbit, projects-as-suns, and galactic lenses, with project clouds, per-instance load and control cards, floating chat cards with a real Markdown composer and mid-turn sends, faceted filter chips, WASD flight, pan and zoom, drag, snapping and alignment guides, marquee multi-select, and fly-to-thread from Cmd/Ctrl+K.
- Messaging Automations - Rebuilt Automations into an operator-ready workflow: a clear list and editor organized around what each automation runs as, condition-list inbound filters, scoped sender access, explicit execution identity, routing, and lifecycle visibility. Automations were validated end to end against Slack.
- Slack - Added a branded Slack App Home, agent and binding identity on replies, and opt-in Live Working Updates cards so one rate-aware Thinking Steps card shows an agent's progress instead of filling the channel with streaming messages. Also added Settings-managed routes, persisted sender labels, private terminal responses, and final assistant image delivery.
- Messaging Access Control - Added role-based access control for messaging actors and destinations, with a configurable capability catalog, a dedicated Access Control pane with a permission graph, auditable decisions, and fail-closed behavior on invalid policy. Existing setups keep working unchanged until a policy is defined.
- Messaging Files - Added the `send_messaging_file` agent tool, letting an agent deliver an approved local file through a connected messaging surface.
- Grok Build - Added a managed, downloadable PwrDrvr Grok Build runtime with signature verification and in-app update controls, plus ACP steering, rewind, and budget support, Working Updates, image inputs, and end-to-end PwrAgent review on Grok.
- CI Monitor and Auto-Fixer - Added GitHub pull-request monitoring that wakes the owning agent on CI failures or merge conflicts and dispatches bounded repair turns, with linked failed-run context on the auto-fix card, dispatch limits, clear repair ownership, and a settings pane to tune it.
- Attention and Drafts - Added the Attention and Drafts lenses so live, review-ready, unread, and unsent work can be triaged without disturbing the normal Inbox and Recents flows, including per-machine turn counts and unsent-draft chips on thread rows.
- Tool-Output Accounting - Added a tool-output incident explorer with replay-cost visualization, warnings when tool use is amplifying replay cost, one consolidated warning card per thread, and a dedicated tool-call tracking tab.
- Managed Review - Managed review now runs on Grok and Kimi as well as Codex, with per-review provider, model, and reasoning overrides and review tool activity shown directly in the transcript.
- Transcript and Composer - Added LaTeX math rendering, a transcript image gallery, explicit PDF attachment previews with bounded local PDF analysis, rich-text HTML copy, inline code copy, hash thread references and chipified pasted references, navigable tool messages, a compact live run strip above the composer, and adjustable transcript density and text size.
- MCP and Sub-agents - Added Codex MCP server management, status, and reload in Settings, PwrSnap MCP connections, native Codex agent thread and sub-agent disclosure, read-only sub-agent transcript windows, and the ability to stop a running sub-agent.
- Usage and Pricing - Added configurable usage alerts, captured Codex account usage, and added release pricing settings.
- Scheduling - New thread starts can now be scheduled, and scheduled thread actions survive restarts.
- Performance - Kept live transcript updates, review derivation, history paging, and edited-file grouping linear as threads grow, batched live token-usage and tool-invocation writes, filled Star Map clouds on a frame budget, and added a checked-in SQLite write-volume budget for the whole run.
- Reliability - Kept the startup thread on screen instead of flashing the composer, stopped an endless retry for threads Codex no longer has, and repaired Windows Authenticode verification for the bundled Grok runtime at both packaging and launch.
- Minor - Added a Dock profile launcher, a Git settings tab, a troubleshooting settings section, protocol capture controls, sidebar multi-selection, mark-unread, archived-thread filtering, directory active-thread counts, per-line log copy, and copyable local diagnostics.

## v1.0.0-beta.50 - 2026-07-31

- AI Provider Defaults - Added configurable default model, reasoning, access mode, and service tier per provider, applied to new threads and launchpads without overriding saved thread choices.
- GPT-5.6 Pricing and Monitors - Updated GPT-5.6 Terra and Luna pricing and Codex Credits estimates, and made monitor threads use PwrAgent's managed model and reasoning defaults unless explicitly overridden.
- Provider Support - Refreshed ACP model discovery, added Kimi thinking controls and Grok 4.5 effort choices, improved current CLI discovery, and kept disabled providers out of model pickers.
- Messaging Reviews - Added messaging `/review` routing with a project-scoped configuration summary, preserved chosen answers and access, and fixed review lifecycle, response-mode, and Working Updates behavior.
- Messaging Traceability - Linked inbound message origins into the transcript, showing provider and sender attribution while improving Slack file-share authorization, command picker refresh, and pairing behavior.
- Agent Tools and Sub-agents - Exposed PwrAgent tools to ACP agents over MCP and added live sub-agent lifecycle activity to transcripts and detail views.
- Pull Requests - Added background pull-request status polling with priority tiers, live PR link chips, tracked-remote discovery, and correct cross-repository references.
- Thread Reliability - Windowed very large thread histories while preserving Find, kept collapsed directories and launchpad settings stable across navigation, and hardened queued-turn, terminal, and agent lifecycle handling.
- Minor - Improved contrast for warning toasts, sanitized ACP command output, and updated compatible AI SDK, editor, and tooling dependencies.

## v1.0.0-beta.49 - 2026-07-15

- Composer References - Added `@` directory and file references, with durable chips, reference pickers, and drag-and-drop or paste support for non-image files. Referenced projects are linked to the thread automatically when sent.
- Scheduled Messages - Added Scheduled and Queued indicators to sidebar threads, plus reliable Send now controls and an explicit schedule toggle while editing.
- Integrated Terminals - Running terminals now survive navigation and view refreshes instead of becoming detached from the UI; active terminals are visible from thread rows and the quit dialog.
- Diagnostics - Added Developer Mode heap snapshots and copyable process IDs for investigating idle resource usage.
- Thread Navigation - Added Cmd/Ctrl+K quick thread search, improved find-bar focus behavior, and stopped streamed transcript updates from unexpectedly scrolling the current view.
- Launchpads and Directories - Cancelling a new-thread or sub-thread launchpad now clears stale persisted drafts and phantom directory rows while preserving recoverable text with ArrowUp; empty directories can now be removed directly.

## v1.0.0-beta.48 - 2026-07-13

- GPT-5.6 Models - Added Codex GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna to model discovery and pickers, including model-specific reasoning choices such as `max` and `ultra`, per-model reasoning memory, and GPT-5.6 pricing/Codex Credits estimates.
- Composer Scheduling - Added scheduled sends from the composer, with quick choices like 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, and future reset timing when available; scheduled drafts stay editable/deletable until dispatch.
- Tool Output Accounting - Added opt-in experimental tool-output accounting in the Pricing panel, including noisy command categories, recent invocations, warning/error/debug counts, truncation signals, and polling alerts.
- Messaging - Fixed Telegram Stop buttons after controller restarts, restored queued Steer actions when an active turn still exists, and kept messaging handoffs targeted at the requested repo instead of falling back to scratch/generated workspaces.
- Handoffs and PR Refresh - Prevented cross-project handoffs from becoming broken subthreads, and refreshed retained PR chips correctly for detached-HEAD worktree threads.
- Reliability and Navigation - Added quit confirmation for running integrated terminals, hardened terminal shutdown callbacks, kept background title-helper usage on standard pricing, and revealed history-selected threads in collapsed or scrolled-out sidebar sections.
- Agent Tooling - Added a repo-local Codex rollout forensics skill for bounded tool-output accounting analysis.

## v1.0.0-beta.47 - 2026-07-09

- AI Providers - Fixed Refresh and backend discovery so disabled ACP providers are no longer probed, preventing disabled agents such as Gemini from triggering browser login flows while still allowing cached disabled entries to remain visible.
- Codex Discovery - Updated Codex discovery so Settings can find Codex from renamed ChatGPT.app bundles and Homebrew installs even when PwrAgent launches with a sparse macOS PATH.

## v1.0.0-beta.46 - 2026-07-09

- Linked Projects - Fixed attached managed worktrees so their observed branch stays scoped to the linked directory instead of overwriting the thread-wide branch, preventing false branch drift and stale branch chips.
- Pull Request Discovery - Updated post-turn PR refresh to use branch/path context per linked workspace, so secondary attached worktrees can attach matching PRs without corrupting primary workspace metadata.
- Review Command - Fixed the `/review` project picker so switching projects refreshes the base branch list, default branch, commit suggestions, and review working directory for the selected workspace.
- Launchpad - Preserved the operator's current thread selection while a directory launchpad is still materializing, so late setup completion no longer yanks focus back to the newly created thread.
- Worktree Branch Picker - Fixed grouped new-worktree subthreads so branch pickers keep the full branch inventory when git status arrives before the synthetic launchpad row exists.

## v1.0.0-beta.45 - 2026-07-07

- Agent Handoffs - Fixed delegated coding threads so handoff-created threads no longer appear as persona Agent threads, while explicit Agent flows and manually marked Agent threads keep their Agent marker.
- Thread Navigation - Normalized existing handoff threads on read so accidental Agent badges from older handoff instructions disappear without clearing intentionally marked Agent metadata.
- Worktree Branches - Improved grouped subthread branch pickers so they immediately show the full known branch inventory, reuse cached branch status across worktrees, and still keep per-worktree current branch and upstream state accurate.

## v1.0.0-beta.44 - 2026-07-07

- Review Command - Fixed `/review` in multi-worktree threads so PwrAgent requires the intended project when ambiguous, runs the review from the selected workspace, and uses the thread-derived base branch instead of guessing `main` or `master`.
- Edits Panel - Corrected edited-file diff stats so dirty chips expand collapsed untracked directories, zero-line changes use file-count labels, and the All files view shows the current net worktree diff instead of historical summed edits.
- Forked Threads - Kept forked-thread Edits views scoped to work done after the fork, so copied ancestor history no longer appears as edits made in the fork.
- Agent Handoffs - Fixed grouped handoffs launched from subthreads so new delegated threads stay visible as siblings under the root thread instead of disappearing as hidden grandchildren.
- Pricing - Preserved completed-turn usage durations after a turn settles or a thread is reopened, keeping elapsed-time cards consistent with live turns.
- Thread Titles - Stopped rejecting generated titles solely because they omit ticket or PR references from quoted prompt context.
- Dependencies - Refreshed production and development dependencies, including `node-pty`, Vite toolchain packages, and npm patch groups.

## v1.0.0-beta.43 - 2026-07-06

- Messaging Working Updates - Reworked messaging progress controls around a single Working Updates dial, with in-turn prose routed through the same coalescing policy and streaming controls hidden by default unless explicitly enabled.
- Messaging Streaming - Fixed provider streaming edits to coalesce with exponential backoff and flush final answers immediately, reducing Telegram/Slack/Mattermost rate-limit pressure during long turns.
- Inbound Automations - Hardened inbound-triggered automations with restart-safe hourly run caps, visible skipped-run markers for throttled messages, and provider-aware destination pickers that preserve friendly conversation titles.
- Slack Authorization - Fixed group-DM detection so Slack slash commands and block actions no longer trust spoofable `mpdm-` channel names when applying conversation access gates.
- Pricing - Added Live turn markers, running per-turn durations, observed cold/hot context replay counts, and sub-agent replay visibility so token usage and cost attribution match what the app actually observed.
- Forked Threads - Fixed forked-thread pricing so inherited parent context is shown as a zero-cost fork point instead of being re-billed as a historical usage estimate.
- Messaging Activity - Fixed the MSG titlebar popover hover path so operators can move from the status button into the panel without pinning it open.
- Tooling - Added correctness-only ESLint in CI without adopting Prettier, then reduced the baseline warning count by removing dead code and low-risk hygiene issues.

## v1.0.0-beta.42 - 2026-07-04

- Updates - Fixed macOS restart-to-update so Squirrel.Mac can finish swapping the downloaded app before PwrAgent quits or relaunches, preventing relaunch into the old version or exiting without applying the update.
- Release Publishing - Fixed prerelease-tagged builds so future beta releases are born as GitHub `Pre-release` instead of accidentally becoming Latest before operator promotion.
- Dependencies - Refreshed production AI and messaging SDK dependencies, including AI SDK, xAI, Feishu/Lark, LINE, and Mattermost packages.

## v1.0.0-beta.41 - 2026-07-03

- Inbound Automations - Added Slack and Telegram message-triggered automations with provider/conversation pickers, sender and text filters, live preview, task prompts, and reply-to-source or Agent-context-only results.
- Automation Safety - Added coalescing, idempotency, per-automation run limits, crash-safe delivery markers, and source-message loop protection for inbound-triggered runs.
- Slack Authorization - Redesigned Slack access around explicit DM, team, channel, channel-user, response-mode, and group-DM controls, with locked-down defaults for fresh configs.
- Slack Pairing and Settings - Reworked Slack pairing, onboarding, and Settings so operators can approve users, channels, and teams independently from one observed pairing flow.
- Messaging Delivery - Fixed provider streaming so Slack, Mattermost, and Feishu post the first stream chunk then edit it, and stopped completed turns from flooding channels with repeated final messages.
- Messaging Rate Limits - Updated Slack and Mattermost delivery budgets to allow normal agent-turn bursts while preserving throttling for real channel saturation.
- Thread Context - Added thread controls for removing stale PR associations and linking additional project directories without changing the underlying agent transcript.
- Agent Handoffs - Fixed cross-project handoffs so agents bind worktree creation to an explicit trusted target directory instead of accidentally reusing the parent workspace.
- Markdown Files - Added in-app previews for local `.md` transcript links and a detached Files window for opening multiple Markdown files in the thread workspace context.

- Worktree Forks - Improved fork-into-new-worktree flow with immediate environment setup progress, streamed setup output, and corrected branch metadata for detached destination worktrees.
- Branch Context - Added base-branch metadata to thread rows, branch tooltips, and agent-facing thread status so release-branch work can show base branch and ahead/behind-base state.
- Updates - Fixed update checks to ignore tag-only or assetless failed releases instead of 404ing on a missing latest-mac.yml.
- Release Packaging - Pinned Windows packaging to the Visual Studio 2022 runner path and locked that expectation in release:check so native rebuilds do not fail on VS 2026 runner images.
- Reliability - Bounded SQLite WAL/log churn and added guardrails against future append-heavy autoincrement tables.

- Fixed messaging-launched threads so launchpad environment setup runs before the first turn and environment selections are hydrated before the first prompt.
- Polished sidebar and thread-list layout with narrower lens labels, a compact "Dirs" label at small widths, flush sub-thread parent rows, standardized disclosure chevrons, and broader thread-list cache reuse.
- Fixed composer pastes that mix prose and fenced code so paragraph breaks are preserved when rich clipboard HTML is available.
- Fixed the release workflow's Windows setup path by avoiding the pnpm action setup failure mode on Windows runners.

## v1.0.0-beta.33 - 2026-06-14

## v1.0.0-beta.30 - 2026-06-08

- Added the Windows port foundation with a Windows CI lane, NSIS installer packaging, Git-for-Windows bash command execution, process-tree cleanup, and cross-platform path handling. Windows installers are built as unsigned workflow artifacts while code signing is still pending.
- Fixed directory/thread organization so the same thread never appears under multiple directory rows, ACP worktree threads group under their repository row, and pinned thread ordering works globally across Codex and ACP backends.
- Fixed queued replies so they still dispatch after a completed turn changes branch state, while fresh sends continue to run the selected-thread branch-drift preflight.
- Improved messaging-launched threads so the first message is materialized through the normal launchpad path, environment setup can run before the first turn, and partial launch failures bind the created thread instead of orphaning it.

- Reworked ACP provider discovery around the shared agent-kit multi-install engine so Gemini, Grok, Kimi, and Qwen can find PATH installs, well-known install directories, and manual overrides through one consistent path.
- Rebuilt Settings -> AI Providers so Codex and ACP providers live in one screen, each ACP provider appears even when it is not installed, discovered installs can be pinned with Using/Use rows, manual paths work across providers, and providers can be disabled individually.
- Fixed ACP chat launch selection so the launched provider binary matches the install shown as Using in Settings and disabled providers are hidden from new-thread choices.
- Fixed Kimi Code mode handling so Kimi uses one ACP runtime-mode selector and no longer sends the legacy rejected `/yolo` command when the provider advertises its own modes.
- Fixed Gemini ACP recovery paths so failed launchpads can return to the editable draft, concrete Homebrew/user-bin executables are preferred, slow provider failures show visible waiting activity, and reloaded Gemini threads keep their real history.
- Improved ACP transcript reliability by keeping live tool activity in transcript order and adding local smoke/parity harnesses for real-agent ACP validation and the next normalizer migration.

- Reduced renderer CPU from thinking scanner animations by moving scanner phase alignment into CSS animation delays instead of frame-by-frame root variable updates.
- Added release maintenance-branch support for future long-lived `releases/<major>.<minor>` patch trains, with CI and release metadata checks covering `releases/**`.
- Tightened Codex environment profile test isolation so CODEX_HOME assertions no longer leak through the real login-shell environment probe.

## v1.0.0-beta.23 - 2026-06-05

- Fixed Kimi Code ACP discovery so GUI-launched PwrAgent can find the default `~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi` install path and detect ACP support from the `kimi acp --help` exit code instead of brittle help text.
- Added a durable ACP capability freshness cache so opening Settings no longer launches every discovered ACP agent just to refresh capabilities and model lists.
- Improved hot renderer CPU diagnostics with per-core CPU percentages, Settings controls, bounded heap snapshot capture, and live profiler reconfiguration without an app restart.
- Added more preset thread reactions in the thread-list reaction picker.
- Switched desktop Codex App Server protocol usage to the published `@pwrdrvr/codex-app-server-protocol` package while keeping dependency boundaries intact.
- Fixed release packaging so the Lark Suite axios-range shim follows the deployed SDK version instead of silently breaking on SDK upgrades.

- Added a native File -> New Thread command with `CmdOrCtrl+N`, contributed by Serhii Novachenko (@serejja) in #628.
- Added sidebar masthead tooltips for Automations, Settings, and New Thread icon buttons, contributed by Serhii Novachenko (@serejja) in #627.
- Added hot renderer CPU diagnostics that can be enabled from Settings in packaged builds and writes profile-scoped `.cpuprofile` artifacts after sustained renderer CPU spikes.
- Fixed queued and review turn handling so queued blockers persist per thread, stale review Thinking/Stop state clears correctly, and failed or cancelled pre-start queued turns clean up visible pending UI.
- Fixed Codex terminal turn failures so failed turns surface in the transcript and bound messaging conversations instead of disappearing into logs.
- Fixed transcript and automation polish including markdown rendering for automation details, slash autocomplete reopening after query edits, copyable pull request URLs from thread-list chips, and dependency/update maintenance.

- Improved environment actions with clearer spawn-failure diagnostics, stale-shell fallback behavior, terminal-ordered stdout/stderr output, stable live-output selection, and protocol-capture support.
- Fixed desktop usability issues including spellcheck context menus, copyable activity/error cards, clearer unavailable reasons when Codex is logged out, external Codex session filtering, generated Codex chat cleanup, image-only steering-card cleanup, and safer shutdown window lifecycle handling.
- Improved performance, packaging, and maintenance with lazy-loaded Settings/Onboarding screens, renderer vendor chunk splitting, Electron runtime repair, normalized profile log scoping, quieter background polling logs, and dependency updates.

## v1.0.0-beta.19 - 2026-05-30

- Added opt-in native attention notifications for background approval requests, user-input questions, and terminal turn completion/failure/cancellation, contributed by Serhii Novachenko (@serejja) in #578.

## v1.0.0-beta.6 - 2026-05-16

- Moved the macOS release pipeline to a two-stage build where the prepare job runs tests, builds the signing input without Apple secrets, hashes the artifact, and hands it to a protected signing job.

- Improved transcript markdown rendering with dedicated table bubbles, content-aware table column profiling, horizontal overflow handling, and better layouts for review/findings tables.
- Fixed several desktop stability issues, including navigation refresh loops, queued-turn release timing, accepted branch-drift state, Codex app-server PATH hydration, Git discovery failures, and stale messaging state for archived threads.
- Added in-app changelog access from Settings and the Help menu, with `CHANGELOG.md` shipped in the Electron bundle.

- Improved Codex and desktop workflow safety with auth profile mapping, local-mode fallback outside git repositories, safer handoff behavior that avoids rewriting rollout files, grouped profile scratch projects, and clearer branch-drift dialogs.
- Added navigation and workspace polish with recents thread pins, directory-scoped pinned threads, refreshed git and PR metadata, archive cleanup failure reporting, and transcript/composer spacing fixes.
- Updated distribution readiness with the placeholder `pwragent` npm package, MIT license metadata, generated third-party license disclosures, and release packaging checks that ship first-party and third-party license files.
