# Release

Use this skill for PwrAgent desktop releases published by the
`.github/workflows/release.yml` macOS, Windows and Linux workflow.

## Read First

Read these files before changing release metadata:

1. [../../../docs/desktop-release-runbook.md](../../../docs/desktop-release-runbook.md)
2. [../../../docs/desktop-distribution-phase-2-runbook.md](../../../docs/desktop-distribution-phase-2-runbook.md) when the release affects update feeds or distribution repos
3. [../../../.github/workflows/release.yml](../../../.github/workflows/release.yml)
4. [../../../scripts/check-desktop-release-metadata.mjs](../../../scripts/check-desktop-release-metadata.mjs)
5. [../../../docs/package-manager-distribution.md](../../../docs/package-manager-distribution.md) for every release, including prereleases
6. [../../../.github/workflows/package-manager-distribution.yml](../../../.github/workflows/package-manager-distribution.yml)

## Guardrails

- `main` remains the active `N.N` release train through its alpha and beta
  candidates, first stable release, and follow-up `N.N.P` releases. Cut a
  long-lived maintenance branch named `releases/<major>.<minor>` only after the
  product owner explicitly decides to begin the next major/minor train on
  `main`. Do not include the patch component in maintenance branch names: use
  `releases/1.0`, not `releases/1.0.x` or `releases/1.0.1`.
- Start from a clean working tree. If tracked files are dirty, stop and ask
  before changing release metadata.
- Fetch tags before planning:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin --tags
  ```

- Treat `apps/desktop/package.json` as the desktop release version source.
  The root `package.json` version is not the desktop app release version.
- Always use a leading-`v` tag such as `v1.0.0-alpha.5`.
- The tag version, `apps/desktop/package.json` version, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` release heading must match.
- Desktop Settings expose two axes: **channel** (Stable or Beta) and
  **track** (Latest or Prerelease). Encode those slots in the tag suffix
  so GitHub `/releases/latest` stays on the Stable Latest train:
  - Stable Latest: `v1.0.5` (no suffix; GitHub Latest after promotion)
  - Stable Prerelease: `v1.0.6-prerelease.1` (GitHub Pre-release)
  - Beta Latest: `v1.1.0-beta.3` (GitHub Pre-release; smoke-checked `main`)
  - Beta Prerelease: `v1.1.0-alpha.7` (GitHub Pre-release; may not install)
- Keep `-prerelease.N` for Stable RCs. Do not reuse `-beta` for 1.0 RCs;
  `-beta` is the Beta Latest identifier.
- CI publishes every release as a GitHub `Pre-release`, whatever the tag
  suffix. A suffix-free tag left at `prerelease: true` lands in Stable
  Prerelease, so Stable Latest keeps serving the previous stable release until
  an operator promotes the new one. Promotion is the documented final step of
  a release; see "Promote To Latest" below.
- `main` tags with a prerelease suffix must stay GitHub Pre-release so they
  never steal `/releases/latest` from the Stable train. Never promote a
  suffixed tag.
- To promote a smoked alpha to beta, bump `apps/desktop/package.json` and
  add a CHANGELOG heading from `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` to `X.Y.Z-beta.M`, commit,
  and tag that commit. The tree can otherwise match the alpha. Do not add
  a second tag to the alpha SHA: the metadata gate and the baked app
  version both come from `package.json`.
- Never create a maintenance branch merely to promote an accepted beta to its
  suffix-free stable release. When the owner directs the next-train transition,
  cut the maintenance branch from the then-current `main` commit; that commit
  may intentionally include post-release fixes or enhancements beyond the first
  stable tag. Then bump `main` to the next alpha train.
- After that cut, release maintenance candidates and patches for the prior train
  from its `releases/<major>.<minor>` branch.
- Before pushing a release tag, verify the `apple-signing` GitHub Environment
  exists, requires reviewer approval, is scoped to release tags, and has the
  Apple signing/notarization secrets required by the workflow.
- Do not create or push the tag until the version and changelog are committed
  and present on the intended release branch.
- Do not create the GitHub Release by hand before the build succeeds. Let
  electron-builder create or update the release from the signed/notarized CI
  build; the workflow publishes the matching changelog entry to the GitHub
  Release body after release assets are uploaded.
- Do not use GitHub generated release notes as the final notes.
- A release is not complete when the workflow reaches the `apple-signing`
  approval gate. After approval, continue monitoring through the release-notes
  publishing job, and verify the release body is non-empty.
- Do not force-push the default branch or rewrite an existing release tag
  without explicit user approval.
- Keep MIT licensing intact: do not change first-party license metadata or
  remove license disclosures without an explicit policy change.

## Release Branch Preflight

For every release, identify `RELEASE_BRANCH` before editing files:

- Active-train alpha, beta, first stable, or follow-up patch release: `main`.
- Maintenance candidates and patches after a train has been cut:
  `releases/<major>.<minor>`.

If the product owner explicitly decides to start a new major/minor train on
`main`, compare the current desktop version's major/minor with the requested
version's major/minor. The decision authorizes cutting the current train's
maintenance branch; do not infer it from a beta promotion or stable release.
Check whether the branch already exists:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin releases/<current-major>.<current-minor>
```

If it is missing, cut it from the current `main` commit after syncing `main`.
That branch point may contain post-release fixes or enhancements, and must not
be replaced with the first stable tag just because it exists. Then switch back
to `main` and commit the next alpha-version metadata:

```bash
git switch main
git fetch origin main --tags
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c releases/<old-train>
git push origin releases/<old-train>
git switch main
```

For example, keep `1.0.0-alpha.N`, `1.0.0-beta.N`, `1.0.0`, and any `1.0.P`
releases on `main`. Only after the owner directs the `1.1` transition do you cut
`releases/1.0` from the current `main`, then bump `main` to `1.1.0-alpha.1`.

## Prepare Release Metadata

Before changing metadata, run `pnpm release:channels --audit`. Compare GitHub
Latest with the authoritative `pwrdrvr/homebrew-tap` cask and
`microsoft/winget-pkgs` manifest versions. Record identifiers, check time,
source URLs, open submissions and exact blockers in the release handoff.
Investigate ahead/stale channels and reuse pending PRs; do not create duplicate
registrations. An API failure or incomplete search is not an absent package.
Public source audits/searches and verified manifest generation use the
organization-provided public-read-only `DISTRIBUTION_READ_TOKEN`, falling back
to `github.token` for fork checks. Keep unrelated operations on the default token
and submission writes on the separate `DISTRIBUTION_TOKEN`. Confirm selected
repository access through secret metadata only, check expiration with the
organization owner, and arrange rotation before expiry without copying the value
or broadening permissions. Require a successful authenticated audit after rotation.
Retain bounded rate-limit retries; a PAT can still receive HTTP 429 or incomplete
code-search results. Report these as blockers and retry later or narrow the query.
Check automation credential readiness. Prereleases still require this comparison
but do not update either stable package channel.

1. Determine the next version from the previous tag and user intent:

   ```bash
   git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -n 10
   gh release list --limit 10
   ```

2. Update `apps/desktop/package.json` without creating a tag yet:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop version <version> --no-git-tag-version
   ```

   If that command is not available in the current pnpm version, edit only
   `apps/desktop/package.json` and preserve JSON formatting.

3. Add a top `CHANGELOG.md` entry:

   ```md
   ## v1.0.0-alpha.5 - YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

   Write user-facing bullets from merged PRs and direct commits since the last
   release. Preserve the same substance in GitHub release notes.

   Release notes must give context first, not just describe the code delta.
   Start each bullet with the user-visible area or feature, then state whether
   it was added, improved, or fixed. Keep bullets punchy and readable by
   operators:

   ```md
   - Composer - Improved complex Markdown pastes with lists, inline code, and nested code blocks.
   - Thread Search - Escape now dismisses search, pairing with Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F to open it.
   - Thread List Pull Request Info - Merged PR commits no longer show as unpushed work.
   - Minor - Dependency updates and small UI polish.
   ```

   Avoid release-note bullets that only say "Improved handling", "Added
   plumbing", "Updated dependencies", or "Fixed packaging" without naming the
   feature surface and why users should care. Roll maintenance-only changes
   into a short `Minor - ...` bullet unless they materially affect installs,
   updates, or data safety.

4. Run the metadata gate locally before committing:

   ```bash
   RELEASE_TAG=v<version> pnpm release:check
   ```

5. Run normal repo gates unless the user explicitly narrows verification:

   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   ```

## Commit, Land, And Tag

Commit the version and changelog together. Use a signed commit; this repo's git
config should already sign commits with SSH.

```bash
git add apps/desktop/package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): prepare v<version>"
```

Preferred fast path: if maintainer direct-push bypass is enabled for
`RELEASE_BRANCH`, push the signed release metadata commit directly. This avoids
running PR CI and then running the same gates again from the release tag.

```bash
git push origin HEAD:<RELEASE_BRANCH>
git fetch origin <RELEASE_BRANCH> --tags
git pull --ff-only
```

Fallback path: if direct push to `RELEASE_BRANCH` is rejected, push the release
metadata commit to a short-lived release branch, open a PR, wait for required
checks, then **squash merge** the PR. Do not use rebase merge for release
metadata PRs: GitHub may rewrite the commit SHA, which makes it too easy to tag
the pre-merge commit instead of the actual release-branch commit.

Remember that a GitHub squash merge creates a GitHub-authored commit on
`RELEASE_BRANCH`, not the original locally signed commit. If the user requires
the release metadata commit on the release branch itself to be locally signed,
use the direct-push path or ask before using the PR fallback.

```bash
git switch -c release/v<version>
git push -u origin release/v<version>
gh pr create --base <RELEASE_BRANCH> --head release/v<version> \
  --title "chore(release): prepare v<version>" \
  --body-file .local/PR-v<version>.md
gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch --interval 10
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
git fetch origin <RELEASE_BRANCH> --tags
git switch <RELEASE_BRANCH>
git pull --ff-only
```

After the direct push or squash merge, rerun the metadata gate on
`RELEASE_BRANCH`, then create exactly one tag on the actual release-branch
commit.

```bash
RELEASE_TAG=v<version> pnpm release:check
```

If signing tags is configured and works locally, prefer a signed annotated tag:

```bash
git tag -s v<version> -m "v<version>"
```

If signed tags are not available and the user approves an unsigned release tag,
create a lightweight tag instead:

```bash
git tag v<version>
```

Do not silently fall back from a failed signed tag to an unsigned tag. Ask the
user which tag form to use. Before pushing, verify the tag points at
`origin/<RELEASE_BRANCH>` or the intended release-branch commit:

```bash
git tag -v v<version>
git merge-base --is-ancestor v<version> origin/<RELEASE_BRANCH>
```

## Publish

Push the tag after the release metadata is already on `RELEASE_BRANCH`:

```bash
git push origin v<version>
```

The tag push triggers `Release Desktop (macOS universal + arm64 + Windows + Linux DEB)`. The workflow must
pass `Check release metadata` in the no-secret `Test and prepare signing input`
job before the environment-gated `Sign, notarize, publish` job can request
approval and access Apple signing secrets.

For a manual dispatch, verify the tag already exists on GitHub:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin v<version>
gh workflow run release.yml --ref <RELEASE_BRANCH> -f tag=v<version>
```

## Monitor And Verify

Find the run for the release tag and watch it. If it takes a while to appear,
sleep for 5-10 minutes before deciding it failed to start.

```bash
gh run list --workflow release.yml --limit 10
gh run watch <run-id>
```

The `Sign, notarize, publish` job pauses for `apple-signing` Environment
approval. Treat that pause as expected. Before approving, verify the workflow
run is for the intended tag, the tag points at the intended default-branch
commit, and the version/changelog metadata match the tag.

If monitoring is delegated and the monitor stops at the approval gate, resume
monitoring after approval. Do not end the release turn as "done" at the
approval gate; the workflow still has to publish and verify release notes after
assets are uploaded.

On failure, inspect logs yourself:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

After success, verify the release and generated assets:

```bash
gh release view v<version>
gh release download v<version> --dir .local/release/v<version>
ls .local/release/v<version>
```

Expect signed/notarized Universal macOS assets:

- A versioned Universal DMG, such as `PwrAgent-<version>-universal.dmg`.
- A stable `PwrAgent.dmg` alias uploaded by the workflow for
  `https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent.dmg`.
- Universal and arm64 updater ZIPs, each with its own `.blockmap`.
- An Apple Silicon DMG and stable `PwrAgent-arm64.dmg` alias.
- `PwrAgent-macos-SHA256SUMS` covering both targets and aliases.
- One merged `latest-mac.yml`, universal legacy path/hash and both ZIP entries.

The stable `PwrAgent.dmg` alias is intentionally unversioned so the website can
link to the latest release without knowing the current version. Do not remove
or replace it with an arch-suffixed DMG.

The workflow replaces electron-builder's empty/default release notes after
release assets are published. Every release is born as a GitHub `Pre-release`,
including a suffix-free stable tag such as `v1.0.0`; the publish step passes
`--prerelease` unconditionally and fails the job if GitHub did not honor it.
GitHub excludes pre-release entries from `/releases/latest`, which also excludes
them from
`https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent.dmg`
and the default Electron updater feed. Promotion to Latest is a separate
operator action, not part of the workflow.

This release-note publication is required, not cosmetic. Electron-builder may
leave the body empty or duplicate the tag name. If the workflow release-notes
job fails or GitHub temporarily rejects the edit, run the manual fallback after
confirming the extracted notes match the approved changelog entry:

```bash
node scripts/extract-release-notes.mjs \
  --tag v<version> \
  --out .local/release/v<version>/RELEASE_NOTES.md
gh release edit v<version> \
  --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent \
  --notes-file .local/release/v<version>/RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

Verify the final release body before calling the publish step complete:

```bash
gh release view v<version> --json name,body,isPrerelease \
  --jq '{name, isPrerelease, bodyLength: (.body | length)}'
```

The `bodyLength` must be greater than zero and the title/body must match the
approved changelog entry. `isPrerelease` must be `true` at this point — that is
the expected published state for every tag, not a failure signal. If it reads
`false`, the publish step's own assertion should already have failed the job;
investigate before going further.

## Promote To Latest

Promotion is the final step of a stable release and is always an explicit
operator action. Do not promote without the user asking for it.

Promote only a suffix-free tag, and only once all of these hold:

- Every platform asset the tag should carry is attached to the release.
- The updater metadata (`latest-mac.yml`, `latest.yml`, `latest-linux*.yml`)
  is attached and names the published version.
- The release body carries the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
- The build has been smoke-checked on at least one machine.

```bash
gh release edit v<version> --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --latest --prerelease=false
```

No retag is needed. Clearing the flag moves a suffix-free tag from Stable
Prerelease into Stable Latest.

After promotion, follow the package-manager distribution runbook through
platform validation, Homebrew/Winget submissions, review/merge and refreshed
client publication checks. If the promotion did not trigger the workflow,
dispatch `package-manager-distribution.yml` with `submit=true`. Validate
architecture-specific released artifacts and actual downloaded checksums,
signature/notarization, fresh install and previous-version upgrade. Never
substitute an alias URL, an unsigned build or a guessed hash.

The release handoff must report both channel versions and outcomes. Link each
pending PR or failed run, name any credential/CLA/review/index/cache blocker,
and give its next action and last check time. Do not call setup live or channel
updates complete until authoritative remote files and refreshed clients both
resolve the new version. Carry delayed channels forward explicitly; opening a
PR or observing a successful product build does not prove distribution.

Never run this on a suffixed tag such as `v1.1.0-beta.3`. `--latest` repoints
`/releases/latest/download/`, so it would hand the website a beta build while
leaving the app's Stable Latest slot on the previous stable — the updater
requires a candidate to be both suffix-free and non-prerelease.

To undo a premature promotion, restore the flag:

```bash
gh release edit v<version> --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --prerelease
```

## Local Fallback

Use the local path only when CI is unavailable or the user explicitly asks for
local signing/notarization. Follow
[../../../docs/desktop-release-runbook.md](../../../docs/desktop-release-runbook.md)
for required Apple and GitHub secrets.

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop package:dryrun
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop package
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop release
```
