# Release Download Stats

Use this skill to inspect GitHub Release asset metadata for
`pwrdrvr/PwrAgent`. It reports cumulative GitHub `download_count` values for
release assets; it does not identify users and it does not count update-check
polls.

## Workflow

1. Run the bundled script from the repo root:

   ```bash
   python3 .agents/skills/release-download-stats/scripts/release_download_stats.py
   ```

2. For specific releases, pass exact tags or PwrAgent shorthand:

   ```bash
   python3 .agents/skills/release-download-stats/scripts/release_download_stats.py beta.22 beta.21 beta.20
   ```

3. For the latest N releases:

   ```bash
   python3 .agents/skills/release-download-stats/scripts/release_download_stats.py --latest 5
   ```

4. Summarize the results in the response. Prefer:
   - ZIP updater downloads separately from DMG downloads.
   - `PwrAgent.dmg` stable alias separately from versioned DMG assets.
   - Total DMG as `stable alias + versioned DMG` only when useful.
   - `PwrAgent.Setup.exe` and unversioned `PwrAgent-windows-*-setup.exe` aliases separately from versioned `PwrAgent-*-windows-*-setup.exe` assets.
   - Total Windows setup traffic as `stable alias + versioned setup` only when useful.
   - GiB totals for approximate transfer volume.

## Interpretation Rules

- Treat GitHub values as cumulative per asset, not per day.
- State that GitHub does not distinguish manual downloads, bots, CI, or
  auto-updater downloads.
- State that update-check polls against `latest-mac.yml` or `latest.yml` are
  not represented by these installer-asset counts.
- When both `PwrAgent.dmg` and a versioned `.dmg` are present, do not collapse
  them unless the user asks for total DMG traffic.
- Apply the same separation to a stable `Setup.exe` alias and versioned setup
  executables.
- Use UTC timestamps unless the user asks for a local timezone conversion.

## Common Commands

Inspect the script's terminal report:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/release-download-stats/scripts/release_download_stats.py beta.22 beta.21 beta.20
```

Emit JSON for further processing:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/release-download-stats/scripts/release_download_stats.py --json --latest 10
```

## Telegram Responses

For Telegram, summarize asset groups as a short stacked list with a heading,
total downloads and GiB, then one bullet per group. Include deltas only when a
previous snapshot is available. For example:

```text
Since September 29
+43 downloads · +8.36 GiB

Asset groups
• mac updater ZIP — 177 (+12)
• stable DMG — 96 (+3)
• versioned DMG — 116 (+22)
• stable Windows setup — 10 (+1)
• versioned Windows setup — 72 (+5)
```

Keep the interpretation caveats as a normal paragraph. Do not paste the
script's Markdown pipe tables or use a fixed-width alignment grid in a Telegram
response. Native rich tables may be used for structured detail. The adapter
attempts rich delivery first and generates readable regular content if the API
rejects the payload. Do not send a duplicate list alongside the native table.
Older clients can display an update placeholder for rich messages.
