/**
 * Locks the declarations that keep the launchpad's send controls on screen.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent: the two PwrSuite connection cards were
 * direct children of `.thread-view__primary`, a flex column in which
 * nothing could shrink — each card sized to its own content, and the
 * composer was pinned beneath them at `flex: 0 0 auto`. `.thread-view`
 * clips with `overflow: hidden` and shows no scrollbar, so once the cards
 * plus a composer holding pasted images exceeded the pane, the composer
 * walked off the bottom edge and "Start thread" could not be reached by
 * any means. Measured on the macOS CI lane against the shipped layout:
 * 125px past the clip at a 600px-tall window, the button's centre
 * hit-testing to nothing. (56px past at 800px and 142px at 700px in a
 * headless-Chromium harness over this stylesheet.)
 *
 * jsdom performs no layout, so the invariant is pinned here as the
 * declarations that produce it. `launchpad-composer-bounds.spec.ts`
 * asserts the rendered result.
