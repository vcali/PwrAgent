 * because matching is monotonic: `threadMatchesQuery` is a set of
 * `includes(needle)` tests over fixed haystacks (title, id, branch,
 * agent metadata, PR numbers, directory labels), so extending a query
 * can only ever narrow the result set. A query matching nothing at
 * eight characters cannot start matching at nine. The one exception is a
 * `@project` mention (see `parseThreadJumpQuery`): a trailing `@` is text
 * until its next character turns it into a project filter, so
 * `#release @` can match nothing and go cold before `#release @pine`
 * would have matched. Mentions are a ⌘K filter, and the picker forgoes
 * them past this length. Without this, a `#`
 * anywhere in a sentence keeps the picker armed — and the federated

 * mid-sentence — the exact symptom being fixed. The leading run is
 * stable both as the query grows to the right and as text before the
 * `#` changes.
 *
