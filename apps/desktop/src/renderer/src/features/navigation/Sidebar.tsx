 * app is safe to close.
 *

 * is the point of the tab: "nothing running, nothing unread" has to be legible
 * at a glance without opening the lens, and a count that vanishes at zero
 * makes an idle tab indistinguishable from a tab that lost its data. Grey is
 * also the honest colour — the accent is a signal here, so only a nonzero
