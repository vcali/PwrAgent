   * Expanding a cloud with its "+N more" chip slid the whole map several
   * hundred pixels sideways, and collapsing it slid the map back: the
   * operator asked one cloud for more cards and the map jumped out from
   * under them.
   *
   * So when the anchor moves, the view moves with it by the same amount in

   * Cancelling that shift is the only thing this may do: it never places,

   * not to be re-run on a content change.

   * rescue rather than a placement — the shape `centerStarMapView`
   * describes and declines to build. `clampStarMapView` is a no-op on
   * every view inside its bounds, and the step lands inside them for any
   * view the operator can still use: it preserves each body's screen
   * position, so a map they were looking at is a map they are still
   * looking at. It can only bite when the canvas SHRANK under a view
   * parked hard against the edge that lost the content — folding an
   * expanded cloud back up while pinned to the far corner — and there the
   * choice is a bounded slide or a window of empty sky recoverable only
   * by "Reset view". The slide wins, and it is the reason the canvas size
   * is still an input here.
   *
   * Lanes is exempt: its canvas grows down and to the right from a fixed
   * corner, so nothing it lays out moves what is already drawn.
