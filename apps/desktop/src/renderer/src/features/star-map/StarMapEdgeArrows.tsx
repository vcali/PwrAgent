/**
 * Pointers on the edge of the window to every body the window is not
 * showing, each turned to the bearing of its body and clickable to fly
 * there. The geometry is `computeStarMapEdgeArrows`; this is the DOM.
 *
 * Reads the LIVE view, not React's. A drag, a keyboard flight and a ⌘K
 * flight all paint the canvas transform by hand for their whole duration
 * and commit to state only on landing, so an overlay fed from state would
 * sit still through every gesture and jump at the end — the opposite of
 * "the arrows move as you pan". `subscribe` is pinged on every paint, and
 * `useSyncExternalStore` re-renders just this component, synchronously,
 * so the arrows and the canvas land in the same frame. That is cheap
 * because the component is a dozen nodes; the screen as a whole is not,
 * which is why `paintView` exists in the first place.
 *
 * The window box comes from the live path too (`getViewport`), for the
 * same reason: a resize writes the new box synchronously in the observer
 * and only commits it to state a frame later, so an overlay reading the
 * state would place its rail against the previous window for that frame.
 *
 * No `useMemo` around the geometry: `view` is a fresh object on every
 * painted frame, so a memo keyed on it could never hit — it would be one
 * discarded deps array per frame for a cache that always misses. The
 * cheap win is upstream, in the memo comparator, which stops the render
 * from happening at all when nothing moved.
