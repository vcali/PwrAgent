/**
 * Main → renderer push: tell the main-window renderer to open the
 * Settings overlay. Triggered from the PwrAgent → Settings… menu
 * item (macOS) or File → Settings… (Linux/Windows), and from the menu
 * items that land on one section (About, New Profile…, Manage
 * Profiles…). `subsection` names a sub-screen within `section`.
 * Settings is an
 * in-renderer overlay, not a separate BrowserWindow, so the main
 * process can't open it directly — it sends a message and the
 * renderer's App shell switches `mainView` to "settings".
 *
 * Picks the focused window first (typical case: the user just used
 * the menu so the main window IS the focused one), then falls back
 * to any main-window subscriber from the window-channel registry.
 * The fallback matters when the focused surface is a secondary
 * window (Messaging Activity, Logs, Changelog) — those don't host
 * the Settings overlay, so we have to dispatch to the actual main
 * window.
