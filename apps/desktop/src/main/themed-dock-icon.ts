/**
 * macOS: a running instance's Dock icon follows its profile's color theme, so
 * two instances on two profiles in two themes are told apart in the Dock.
 * Each instance is its own Dock tile (the Dock menu's Open Profile launches
 * with `createsNewApplicationInstance`), and each reads its own profile's
 * config, so the icon is per instance with no coordination.
 *
 * The icon follows the theme on screen: the dark theme in dark mode, the
 * light theme in light mode, so the Dock matches the window. Every icon is a
 * dark tile (the shipped icon is one), so a light theme shows its family's
 * tile: Blue light shows the blue icon, Catppuccin Latte the Catppuccin one.
 * Tangerine keeps the app's own icon in either mode, and so does an instance
 * with `[general.appearance] themed_dock_icon = false`.
 *
 * Only the running Dock tile changes. The icon a stopped app shows is the
 * bundle's, which this does not touch.
 *
 * `app.dock.setIcon()` paints a bitmap literally, and macOS 26 applies
 * Liquid Glass only to a bundle's own Icon Composer icon, never to one set at
 * runtime, and has no API to switch a running app to another. So there are
 * two sets, each the finished tile for the macOS it is shown on:
 * `build/dock-icons/glass/<theme>.png` has macOS 26's glass rim and mark
 * shadow rendered in, and `build/dock-icons/<theme>.png` is the flat tile
 * macOS 15 and earlier draw. Both are written by
 * `scripts/generate-themed-dock-icons.swift` and packaged as
 * `Resources/dock-icons`.
 *
 * The glass set is the Default icon style's. The Dark, Clear, and Tinted
 * styles are kept by the window server behind private API, and a runtime
 * icon is not restyled by any of them, so a themed icon looks the same in
 * every style, as the flat one did.
