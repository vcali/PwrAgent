# Desktop App Guidance

## Style Guide

Use [../../docs/UI-THEME.md](../../docs/UI-THEME.md) as the visual theme source of truth for renderer UI work.

Use [../../docs/design/desktop-style-guide.md](../../docs/design/desktop-style-guide.md) for broader desktop layout, product tone, component behavior, and copy guidance.

The theme guide defines:

- theme thesis
- palette and token usage
- component theme rules
- interaction constraints
- visual anti-patterns

The desktop style guide defines:

- product tone
- typography
- shell composition
- sidebar and thread-row rules
- component constraints
- copy rules
- anti-patterns

## Code Formatting & Linting

ESLint is the correctness linter — run `pnpm lint:eslint` (CI runs it too) and
fix its errors; **don't run `eslint --fix` to reformat**. There is no
autoformatter by design: **never run Prettier (`npx prettier` /
`prettier --write`)** on a renderer or main-process file — no config is
committed, so `npx` applies tool defaults that fight the hand-maintained house
style (notably leading binary operators) and reformat untouched code. Match the
surrounding file by hand. See "Code Formatting & Linting" in the
[repo-root `AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for the full rule and the house-style
summary.

## Non-Negotiables

- Attention, Drafts, Inbox, Recents, and Directories live in one icon-only
  thread lens switch; Inbox is the default browsing lens.
- A thread's unsent composer draft is window-local state, never federated.
  Derive it from the composer draft store (`useThreadDraftIndicators`), not
  from `NavigationThreadSummary`.
- Attention is a work queue: focusing a thread there must not clear its unread
  cookie, only replying does. See "Current Product Direction" in the
  [repo-root `AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for why that rule is lens-scoped
  rather than global.
- Attention rows are ranked per turn, not per update
  ([attention-order.ts](src/renderer/src/features/navigation/attention-order.ts)).
  Do not re-sort the lens by `updatedAt` — that is the bug the ranks exist to
  fix. New signals that should move a row need a transition in the reducer, not
  a tiebreaker in the sort.
- User-curated Pins live as a scrollable section at the top of each directory
  in the Directories lens. Inbox and Recents are pure sort orders and do not
  float pins.
- Unread state uses the orange cookie marker, not punctuation badges.
- The sidebar is an information surface, not a stack of generic cards.
- Do not use browser-default controls in shipped UI.
- Do not ship implementation-status narration in user-facing copy.
- Keep radius at `8px` or below.
- Favor one accent color and neutral surfaces.

### Worktree Archive and Migration Safety

- Archive only non-primary worktrees after creating their snapshots.
- Validate migrated destination history before archiving the source thread.

### Branch-Drift Dialog

- Use `isBranchDrifted` for sidebar and dialog decisions so both surfaces share
  one predicate.
- Defer branch-drift dialogs during active turns and recheck the selected thread
  after the turn settles.

### Native Notifications

- Keep native notification eligibility and deduplication in the main process.
- Emit notifications only for opted-in inactive windows and clear waiting keys
  after user action or terminal completion.

### Markdown and External Links

- Treat bare domains and local paths as text; only explicit links may open
  externally.
- Validate external URLs in the main process with an allowlist after renderer
  filtering.

### Star Map Interactions

- Interactive Star Map children must guard canvas pan, wheel, and keyboard
  handlers before shipping.
- The map publishes its on-screen state to the main process for the
  `read_star_map_view` Agent tool. Keep that snapshot in memory only and keep
  it built inside the publisher's throttle — it sits on the drag path, so the
  input it is given must not build collections either. Read
  [../../docs/star-map-manager.md](../../docs/star-map-manager.md) before
  changing the snapshot shape, the manager thread's identity, or how its
  instructions are delivered.
- Agent commands to the map (`fly_star_map_to`,
  `highlight_star_map_threads`, `set_star_map_view`) arrive through
  `useStarMapCommands` and must be answered exactly once, even when the
  handler throws: main holds the Agent's tool call open until the map
  replies. Each answer carries its command's kind, and main drops one that
  does not match. No Agent command may move keyboard focus. An Agent's
  highlight is its own ring, never written into the operator's selection.

### Full Access Escalation

- Every renderer surface that can raise a thread's execution mode routes the
  selection through `useExecutionModeSelection`
  ([lib/useExecutionModeSelection.tsx](src/renderer/src/lib/useExecutionModeSelection.tsx)),
  never through `desktopApi.setThreadExecutionMode` directly. The gate owns the
  "Enable Full Access?" confirmation and the dismissed-forever preference; a
  surface that calls the API itself is a one-click, un-gated escalation, which
  is what the Star Map chat card's settings chip was while the dialog lived
  inside `Composer`.
- A surface with a live settings snapshot (the main window's `App`) passes
  `dismissed` / `onDismiss`; anything else lets the gate read and write the
  preference itself.
- Messaging surfaces deliberately do NOT share this gate. An escalation
  requested over Telegram or Discord is made by a remote actor, so
  `MessagingController.ensureFullAccessEscalationAllowed` gates it on the
  `thread.execution.full_access` permission, the operator's `warningPolicy`,
  and a per-contact dismissal. The desktop-local preference is the operator's
  own acknowledgement and must never dismiss a contact's warning.

## Codex Data Boundary

Desktop code must not inspect Codex-owned storage directly. Do not open, parse,
query, or infer behavior from Codex session JSONL files, rollout files, or
Codex sqlite databases, even when the Codex App Server protocol returns a path
to one of those files. Use protocol fields from the Codex App Server instead.
PwrAgent-owned JSONL, sqlite, config, and replay fixture files remain OK when
the desktop app or test harness owns that data. CI runs
`pnpm lint:codex-storage` to catch common violations; do not bypass or rename
around that check. Fix the data flow by using protocol fields or changing the
protocol. The one PwrDrvr LLC-authorized exception is
`src/main/codex-app-server/invalid-response-message-id-recovery.ts`: it may
rewrite only the protocol-identified rollout for the exact Responses API
invalid message-ID-prefix recovery, after stopping the Codex writer, creating
a durable backup, and validating the session belongs to the requested thread.

## Codex Runtime Safety

- Keep Windows sandbox setup explicit, active-profile scoped, and delegated to
  Codex.
- Never elevate the Electron process or claim readiness before restart and
  fresh readiness evidence.

## Running the App for Development

Choose the target checkout and profile before starting or controlling an app.
For a checkout-bound `dev` profile, use the project-local
[`pwragent-dev-profile` skill](../../.agents/skills/pwragent-dev-profile/SKILL.md):

```bash
.agents/skills/pwragent-dev-profile/scripts/pwragent-dev-profile.zsh status --root "$PWD"
.agents/skills/pwragent-dev-profile/scripts/pwragent-dev-profile.zsh restart --root "$PWD"
```

Run `status` first and only `restart` when a new process is actually wanted.
The skill supplies both `PWRAGENT_PROFILE=dev` and
`PWRAGENT_INSTANCE_ROOT="$PWD"` so it manages the instance for this checkout.
Use the
[`pwragent-dev-restart` skill](../../.agents/skills/pwragent-dev-restart/SKILL.md)
for a delayed restart that must survive the current in-app Agent session.

To launch the desktop app with live threads and real user state, run from the **repo root** (or worktree root):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Do **not** override `HOME` or set `NODE_ENV` — the app needs the real user data directory to load saved threads and Keychain secrets.
- Messaging adapters are guarded by a profile-scoped sqlite lease. A shared runtime lease manager records the owning PID, runtime instance ID, and start time once, then verifies that identity against the existing profile runtime marker when another instance challenges the lease. A matching live identity remains authoritative across wall-clock corrections. Once the identity is absent, an owner that predates the current OS boot is reclaimed immediately; otherwise the first confirmed absence is persisted and a one-minute reclaim grace protects a temporarily hung process. PID reuse cannot revive the dead owner. If another live instance already owns messaging for the active profile, this process stays usable but leaves messaging stopped.
- The federation runtime asks the same lease manager for a parallel profile-scoped lease (lease key `profile-federation`, independent of the messaging lease). If another live instance already runs federation for the active profile, this process keeps its federation runtime stopped and reports the holder in federation health instead of fighting over the shared instance identity.
- Use `pnpm dev:no-messaging` when you explicitly want to guarantee that this app process never starts messaging adapters.
- For visual verification of UI changes, either command can show real threads in the sidebar and thread detail pane; prefer `dev:no-messaging` when the UI work does not need live messaging.
- If the app starts but shows no threads, you are likely running from the wrong directory or with overridden env vars.

### Targeting an Existing Electron App

- Confirm the intended checkout/profile with the dev-profile skill before
  driving a window. Dev builds run as the generic `Electron` process and share
  the `com.github.Electron` bundle id with every other unsigned Electron app.
  **Never target either generic identity.** Do not target the installed
  `com.pwrdrvr.pwragent` bundle either: it is a packaged build and does not
  contain the checkout's code.
- Launch or inspect with the project-local dev-profile skill. Its successful
  `status` / `restart` / `verify` output includes a `Computer Use target` line
  with the checkout-local Electron main PID, exact `Electron.app` path,
  expected native window title (`PwrAgent`), and renderer URL/port. For Computer
  Use, target that exact app path, then confirm the returned window title and
  AX URL match before clicking anything. The title alone is not unique when
  another PwrAgent checkout is open; the port alone is not enough without the
  checkout-local executable and `--app-path` process evidence.
- If the target cannot be resolved unambiguously, stop instead of guessing.
  An ambiguous lookup can raise or operate a sibling Pwr app, another checkout,
  or an unrelated project's broken default Electron window.
- With a Codex browser/Electron controller, select and reuse the existing
  PwrAgent Electron target and its window/page binding. With persistent
  `node_repl` Playwright, reuse the existing `electronApp` and `appWindow`
  handles. Playwright's `_electron.launch()` always creates a new process; it
  cannot attach those handles to an arbitrary Electron app that was started
  elsewhere, so use Computer Use or an existing controller binding instead.
- If a separate Playwright-owned instance is explicitly required, prefer the
  repository's E2E/inspect commands. A manual Playwright launch must pass the
  PwrAgent package entry: `.` with `cwd` set to `apps/desktop`, or
  `apps/desktop` with `cwd` set to the repository root, plus the intended
  `PWRAGENT_PROFILE` and `PWRAGENT_INSTANCE_ROOT` environment.
- **Never launch `Electron.app`, its `Contents/MacOS/Electron` executable, or
  the repo's Electron binary without the PwrAgent app entry/path.** A bare
  Electron launch opens Electron's default shell, not PwrAgent.

## Profiling the Renderer with React DevTools

Nothing in the app connects React DevTools on its own. Two opt-in env vars,
both read by [`electron.vite.config.ts`](electron.vite.config.ts) at Vite
config time, turn it on:

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS=1` | Injects `<script src="http://localhost:8097">` as the first `<head>` script so the renderer loads the standalone DevTools backend. |
| `PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS_HOST` / `_PORT` | Point that script somewhere other than `localhost:8097`. |
| `PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_PROFILING=1` | Aliases `react-dom/client` → `react-dom/profiling` for `electron-vite build` only. |

With both unset the plugin is never constructed and the alias key is never
added, so a normal build is byte-identical to one from a tree without this
feature. That was verified by building from both configs and diffing
`out/renderer` — no output difference.

### Attaching to the dev build

This is the configuration to reach for first, and it needs no build changes.

```bash
npx react-devtools
```

Then, from the repository root, start the app for this checkout with the
bridge enabled:

```bash
PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS=1 .agents/skills/pwragent-dev-profile/scripts/pwragent-dev-profile.zsh restart --root "$PWD"
```

The skill's daemon passes the current environment through to `pnpm dev`, so
exporting the variable before the call is enough. `npx react-devtools` must
already be listening when the renderer loads; the script tag is a synchronous
classic script, and a refused connection simply means React never registers a
renderer with the hook.

Do not add `react-devtools` to `package.json`. It depends on `electron@^23`,
which would pull a second Electron runtime into `node_modules` alongside the
one the app actually uses.

### Knowing which instance you attached

Several PwrAgent checkouts usually run at once on this machine and the
standalone DevTools window says nothing about which page is on the other end
of its socket. Two things resolve it:

- The bridge is opt-in per process. An instance started without
  `PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS=1` has no script tag and *cannot* connect, so
  starting exactly one bridged instance is itself the isolation.
- The injected bridge logs its endpoint and the checkout it was built from to
  the renderer console:
  `[pwragent] React DevTools bridge -> http://localhost:8097 (renderer from /…/apps/desktop)`.
  Open that window's own Electron DevTools and read the line to confirm.

To profile two checkouts at once, give each its own port and run one
`react-devtools` per port:

```bash
npx react-devtools --port 8098
PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS=1 PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS_PORT=8098 …
```

Every window in the process loads the same renderer bundle, so auxiliary
windows (Star Map, Settings, Activity) carry the bridge too. The standalone
server accepts one connection at a time and logs a warning when it replaces
an earlier one.

### Which build to use for what

**Use the dev build to find re-render storms and update loops.** It is the
better tool for that, not a fallback:

- The Profiler's "Record why each component rendered" attribution is richer
  in a development build — it reports the specific changed props by name and
  the changed hook indices (`Hook 7 changed`). The production profiling build
  drops some of that detail.
- No build step, no packaging, and HMR still works.
- A pathology shows up as a *ratio* — components re-rendered per commit,
  or commits per interaction — and ratios survive the dev build's overhead
  intact.

**Use the profiling build only when an absolute millisecond number has to be
trustworthy.** Development React is much slower than production React and the
overhead is uneven across component shapes, so dev-build durations rank badly
against each other and must never be quoted as the cost users pay. A plain
production build is not an option here: it reports "Profiling not supported"
because production `react-dom` is compiled without the timing
instrumentation.

The profiling build is **not** a prerequisite for spotting a storm. Reach for
it after the dev build has told you where to look.

```bash
PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_PROFILING=1 PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS=1 pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop build
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop preview
```

Measured cost of the alias on the renderer bundle, `react-dom` 19.2.8:

| | baseline | profiling | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vendor-react-*.js` raw | 382,982 B | 402,937 B | +19,955 B (+5.2%) |
| `vendor-react-*.js` gzip | 118,127 B | 123,956 B | +5,829 B (+4.9%) |
| whole `out/renderer` | 5,463,569 B | 5,483,765 B | +20,196 B (+0.4%) |

Only `react-dom/client` is aliased. Bare `react-dom` (`createPortal`,
`flushSync`) and `react-dom/server` keep resolving normally, and that is what
keeps one reconciler in the bundle: in React 19 both `react-dom/client` and
`react-dom/profiling` require the shared bare `react-dom` module for their
internals, so swapping the client entry alone cannot produce two copies.
Confirm a build really is the profiling one by grepping the chunk for a
Profiler-only fiber field — `treeBaseDuration` appears 21 times in the
profiling bundle and 0 times in the baseline.

### The DevTools browser extension does not work here

`electron-devtools-installer` plus the React DevTools MV3 extension is a dead
end on Electron 41, and the half that works makes it look like it might.
Measured on Electron 41.10.7 with React Developer Tools 8.0.0:

- The extension installs and Electron accepts `manifest_version: 3`.
- Its background **service worker runs**.
- Content-script injection works — `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` is
  installed in the page with the full hook API. The old `chrome.scripting`
  blocker from 2023 is genuinely gone.
- **The extension's `devtools_page` never loads.** No webContents is created
  for it, and no Components or Profiler tab appears in Electron's DevTools,
  with the window shown or hidden.

So the backend half attaches and the frontend half does not, which yields a
hook and no UI. Use the standalone route.

### Packaging cannot ship the bridge

`PWRAGENT_DEV_REACT_DEVTOOLS` is read at build time, so nothing at app
runtime can undo a renderer HTML that was built with it.
[`verify-asar-contents.mjs`](scripts/verify-asar-contents.mjs) fails packaging
when any packaged HTML loads a remote script; `release.mjs` runs it on every
packaging path. The rule is written against the shape — a remote `<script
src>` in a shipped renderer — not against the flag.

All four variables are also listed in `rejectDevOnlyEnvVarsInProduction`
([`src/main/index.ts`](src/main/index.ts)). The `delete` there is inert for
them, since this process never reads them; the point is the `console.error`
line, so an operator who exports one and then launches a packaged build is
told it did nothing instead of wondering why the Profiler never connects.

## E2E Locator Hygiene Around Global Chrome

The thread/search title bars always render the history Back/Forward
buttons (accessible names `Back` and `Forward`), and they stay mounted
behind overlays like the onboarding wizard. A page-wide
`getByRole("button", { name: /Back/i })` will resolve to multiple
elements and fail Playwright strict mode. When writing specs:

- Scope to a container (`dialog.getByRole(...)`) or anchor the regex to
  the full label (e.g. the wizard's `/^← Back/i`).
- Target the history buttons themselves via their test ids:
  `history-nav-back` / `history-nav-forward`.

The composer's stop-the-turn button is the same story and has the test id
`composer-stop-turn`. Use it rather than `getByRole("button", { name:
"Stop" })`, which 21 call sites across 10 specs once relied on. Adding the
active sub-agents strip broke every one of them, because a row control named
"Stop sub-agent: <task>" still matches: **Playwright matches an accessible
`name` as a normalized substring by default**, so qualifying the new button's
label was not enough — only `exact: true` or a test id disambiguates. The
`toHaveCount(0)` assertions were the sharpest edge, since they assert no Stop
button exists anywhere in the window.

Note the vitest/Playwright asymmetry when you write a unit test to guard one
of these: Testing Library matches a string `name` **exactly**, so a unit
assertion that "Stop" no longer resolves will pass while the Playwright
locator it was meant to protect still breaks.

The same trap runs in the other direction, and it bites the *renderer*
rather than the spec: **`getByLabel` matches on substring**, and 31 call
sites across 23 specs drive the composer with `getByLabel("Reply")`. A new
`aria-label` anywhere in the app that merely *contains* "reply" turns every
one of them into a strict-mode violation as soon as the labelled element
renders. The unsent-draft chip was originally labelled "Unsent draft reply"
and did exactly that — the unit suite was green and only Desktop E2E caught
it. When you add an `aria-label`, grep the specs for the words in it before
you settle on the wording.

## Inspecting Branch Drift Dialog E2E

To open the replay-backed "Thread branch changed" dialog and keep Electron
open for manual screenshots, run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop inspect:e2e:branch-drift
```

The script builds the desktop app, launches a deterministic branch-drift
fixture in headed Electron, waits with the dialog visible, and exits only
after you close the Electron window or quit the app. Use this for visual
inspection of the dialog instead of the normal `thread-branch-drift.spec.ts`,
which closes Electron automatically after assertions pass.

## Capturing README Screenshots

The PNGs and animated GIF the top-level README references under
`docs/assets/screenshots/` are produced by an inspect-style Playwright
spec that drives five known UI surfaces and shells out to Swift for
native macOS window capture (with stoplights, drop shadow, and retina
resolution — Playwright's `Page.screenshot()` only grabs the renderer
DOM, which loses the OS chrome).

Re-capture all five with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop screenshot:readme
```

For the **docs-site** screenshots (the `docs.pwragent.ai` site —
Settings → Applications / Worktrees / Models panels, Settings →
Messaging panels for each of the six platforms, and a Recents lens
hero), the docs themselves live in a separate repo at
[pwrdrvr/docs.pwragent.ai](https://github.com/pwrdrvr/docs.pwragent.ai)
but the capture pipeline still lives here. The command is:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop screenshot:docs-site
```

It runs the same `capture-window.swift` pipeline as the README
screenshots and uses `PWRAGENT_DOCS_SITE_SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE=1` as
its gate. PNGs are written into the **sibling docs.pwragent.ai
checkout**'s `assets/screenshots/` directory — by default
`~/github/docs.pwragent.ai/assets/screenshots/`, overridable via
the `PWRAGENT_DOCS_SITE_REPO` environment variable when your
checkout lives somewhere else. After the run, `cd` into that
checkout to review + commit the captured PNGs. See the docs repo
for its own SHOT_LIST tracking.

### Capturing under a non-default theme or density

Both screenshot pipelines honor two optional env vars that seed the
launched profile's `[general.appearance]` block before Electron boots:

- `PWRAGENT_SCREENSHOT_THEME` — `dark` (default), `light`, or `system`.
- `PWRAGENT_SCREENSHOT_DENSITY` — `mission-control` (default) or `compact`.

Defaults match the committed PNGs (dark + mission-control), so omitting
the variables leaves the existing pipeline pixel-stable. The pre-React
bootstrap (main → preload → inline script in `index.html`) applies the
matching `<html data-*>` attributes on the first paint, so no UI driving
is required to flip the theme — just set the env var:

```bash
PWRAGENT_SCREENSHOT_THEME=light \
  pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop screenshot:readme
```

The wiring lives in
[`e2e/fixtures/screenshot-appearance.ts`](e2e/fixtures/screenshot-appearance.ts)
and is consumed by both inspect specs. The capability is intentionally
scoped to the screenshot pipelines — production E2E keeps its dark
default unconditionally so color-assertion tests stay deterministic on
every CI runner.

We do not currently regenerate the committed PNGs under light theme or
ship them in the docs site. That's tracked separately under issue #508
(theming v1 polish follow-up to #472).

The script builds the desktop app, launches it headed against curated
replay fixtures + state-seeded sqlite rows, takes the screenshots,
then runs the **noise filter** (`filter-noise-screenshots.mjs`) to
revert any PNG whose pixels are identical to the committed version
— the `screencapture` encoder produces nondeterministic byte streams
for deterministic input pixels, and PNGs don't delta-compress in
git's pack format, so committing re-encode noise adds ~900 KB per
file per regen for zero visual benefit. macOS Screen Recording
permission is required for whichever terminal/IDE runs the spec —
the first invocation triggers the system prompt; subsequent runs
are silent.

**Captures must come off a Retina (2x) display**, and the specs place
the window on one for you. `screencapture -l` renders at the backing
scale of whichever display the window occupies and offers no flag to
request 2x, so a run with the window on a 1x external monitor silently
produces half-resolution PNGs. The noise filter does not catch this —
half-res pixels *are* different pixels, so it keeps them. On
2026-09-01 a run in exactly that state overwrote all 21 committed
docs-site PNGs at half resolution, and 8 also caught a stray toast.

Two layers now prevent it:

* `e2e/fixtures/capture-window-placement.ts` centers the window on a
  Retina display before every capture. It probes the displays once, on
  the first `bringToFront` of the run, and trusts that probe for the rest
  of the run. Only 2x displays are eligible —
  a 1x panel cannot produce the asset at all — and among those it
  prefers one the window actually fits on, then the built-in panel (the
  usual laptop-docked-to-a-1x-monitor case), then the sharpest. It never
  resizes (the committed PNGs depend on the window size the spec sets),
  warns if no 2x display is attached, and throws if the window a capture
  targets cannot be found rather than silently capturing an unplaced
  one. Its selection rule is pure and unit-tested in
  `src/main/__tests__/capture-window-placement.test.ts`; the `evaluate`
  callbacks only read and write Electron state, because anything inside
  one is unreachable from Vitest. That test lives under `src/main/`
  rather than beside the fixture because `e2e/` is Playwright's
  `testDir` and its default `testMatch` claims `*.test.ts` — the same
  reason `sub-agent-state-seeding.test.ts` sits there.
* `scripts/capture-window.swift` stages each capture in a temp file,
  checks the observed scale, and exits 6 **without touching the
  destination** when it lands below ~1.5x — or when the staged file
  cannot be decoded to check at all. The check fails closed on purpose.
  The replace itself goes through `replaceItemAt`, so a failure cannot
  leave the destination missing. Pass `--allow-low-dpi` only if you
  genuinely want a 1x asset; both specs forward it when
  `PWRAGENT_SCREENSHOT_ALLOW_LOW_DPI=1`. If the probe found a Retina
  display, `captureWhileFocused` treats a 1x refusal like an inactive-window
  refusal. It raises the window, which places it back on the Retina
  display, and captures again. If the probe found none, the refusal fails
  the capture immediately, because every retry would land on the same 1x
  display.

Both specs pass `--pid=<Electron main pid>` to `capture-window.swift`
through `captureOwnerPidArg`. The script's owner match is the name
"Electron", and every unpackaged Electron app has that name. One run
captured a different Electron dev app that was frontmost at the time,
and wrote its window out as `settings-messaging-line.png`. The
inactive-window check passed as well, because it checked the app that
had been captured, and that app was active. Pass the PID on any new
capture.

Capturing off-screen is fine: `screencapture -l` pulls the window's
full composited image from the window server, so the shadow is never
clipped by a screen edge — verified against a probe window positioned
past the display edge, whose off-screen rows came back at full opacity.
What an oversized window loses is the centering, not the pixels.

Notices are suppressed during capture: unpackaged E2E launches do not
arm the vendor Grok CLI update check (`grokUpdateChecksDisabled` in
`main/acp/grok-cli-update.ts`), because its notice is durable and
would otherwise paint "Grok update available" over whatever the
capture happens to catch. `auto-updater.ts` gates PwrAgent's own
update check on the same predicate.

Hover is suppressed too, for the same reason. Placement slides the
window out from under the OS cursor, which does not move with it, so
whatever lands at the cursor's screen position picks up `:hover` — and
which element that is depends on how far the window moved. A Settings
→ Profiles capture came back with two nav items highlighted this way:
the spec clicked "Profiles" at x=2056, placement moved the window to
x=28, and the stationary cursor came to rest on "General", whose
`:hover` rule paints the same box as `.is-active`. `bringToFront`
therefore parks the pointer at (-10, -10) via `sendInputEvent` after
placing the window. No capture drives hover deliberately; if one ever
needs to, it has to set the hover after `bringToFront`, not before.

Scroll position is the third trap. Chromium snaps a scroll offset to the
device pixels of the display the window is on when the scroll lands, and
moving the window afterwards does not re-snap it. Settings → Messaging →
Slack opens with a smooth scroll to its Connect section, which came to
rest at `scrollTop` 171 when macOS opened the window on a 1x monitor and
at 170.5 when it opened on the Retina panel. The two captures differed
by one device pixel across the whole content pane, so the noise filter
kept both. The docs-site spec therefore calls `bringToFront` once right
after launch, before any navigation, as well as before each capture.
`waitForSettingsScrollToSettle` then holds a Settings capture until the
scroll pane has kept one `scrollTop` for 10 rendered frames, instead of
trusting a fixed delay to outlast the ~250ms smooth scroll.

Content that changes on its own is the fourth trap. None of it is a
rendering difference, so the noise filter keeps every variant. The
docs-site spec pins each source it has met:

* **Motion.** `launchDocsSiteApp` emulates `prefers-reduced-motion`,
  which parks the thinking scanner on its reduced-motion pose instead of
  mid-sweep. It also hides the text caret, which blinks on Chromium's own
  timer.
* **Wall-clock time.** Captures that print a time launch with `TZ=UTC`.
  `pinWallClock` pins `Date.now` in main and the renderer before a turn
  stamps its rows, the way `visual-regression.spec.ts` does. Main stamps
  a profile's `last_used` before the spec can reach it, so
  `pinProfileLastUsed` rewrites `profiles.toml` after launch instead.
* **Measured durations.** The thread context panel's "Initial load" row
  reports how long the first read took, 0 or 1 ms against a replay.
  `pinInitialLoad` sets it to a fixed value before the capture.
* **Temp paths.** Settings → Worktrees prints a path under the home
  root, so that capture launches on a fixed home root instead of an
  `mkdtemp` one.
* **Random tokens.** A pairing token exists only in the Generate
  response; sqlite keeps its HMAC. `pinPairingToken` swaps the displayed
  token for a fixed one of the same length.
* **Host discovery.** Settings → AI Providers reads main's cached
  provider catalog once, as the pane mounts. The spec waits for the
  startup provider refresh to settle before opening it. The rows still
  show whichever CLIs the capturing Mac has installed.

What's left is GPU raster noise, which the spec doesn't pin. Any
capture can come out with a few anti-aliased pixels, on rounded corners,
icon strokes or glyph edges, a few levels off from the last run. Pairing
frame 1's segment corners do it about one run in four. Rarely, one glyph
comes out corrupt. `--disable-gpu-rasterization` isn't a fix. It moved
the variance into other pixels and across batches of runs. Look at a
diff that small before chasing it, and re-capture a corrupt glyph.

Before adding a capture, check it for anything else in that list: dates,
durations, generated IDs, temp paths, spinners, or discovery results.
Then run the spec twice and compare decoded pixels, not PNG bytes.

Pieces, all under `apps/desktop/`:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `e2e/readme-screenshots.inspect.spec.ts` | Five tests, one per surface. Gated behind `PWRAGENT_SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE=1`. |
| `e2e/docs-site-screenshots.inspect.spec.ts` | Tests producing PNGs for `docs.pwragent.ai` (Settings panels + per-provider Messaging panels + Recents hero + composer features + first-run onboarding wizard + live work rail). Gated behind `PWRAGENT_DOCS_SITE_SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE=1`. Output lands in the **sibling docs repo's** `assets/screenshots/` (default `~/github/docs.pwragent.ai/`, override with `PWRAGENT_DOCS_SITE_REPO`). |
| `e2e/fixtures/readme-recents-hero/replay.fixture.json` | Hand-crafted populated thread list for the hero shot. Edit by hand to retune. |
| `e2e/fixtures/readme-state-seeding.ts` | Direct sqlite/config seeders for messaging bindings, activity log entries, pairing tokens, and Telegram-enabled config. |
| `e2e/fixtures/capture-window-placement.ts` | Shared `bringToFront` for both capture specs. Resolves the target window once (optionally by title substring, case-insensitively, matching `capture-window.swift --title=`), centers it on a Retina display so `screencapture` renders at 2x, then raises it and makes it the active app (`app.focus({ steal: true })`), waiting until focus holds for 2s so an app that takes focus back does so before the capture, not during it. `captureWhileFocused` wraps each capture: when `capture-window.swift` refuses an inactive window (exit 7), or a 1x capture (exit 6) while the run has a Retina display, it raises the window and captures again, up to 3 tries. Displays are probed on the first `bringToFront` of a run only. Exports the pure selection rule (`pickCaptureDisplay`, `centeredIn`, `overflowsWorkArea`) and the focus waits (`waitForSteadyFocus`, `captureWhileFocused`) so they can be tested. |
| `e2e/fixtures/docs-site-state-seeding.ts` | All-providers-enabled `config.toml` seeder so the per-platform Settings → Messaging captures can scroll directly to each platform's section without driving the Enabled toggle in the UI. It also saves a Slack agent name (`PwrAgent - riley`), so the Slack capture shows Connect past its Name step instead of the suggestion built from the OS username of whoever runs it. |
| `scripts/capture-window.swift` | Resolves the Electron window's CGWindowID and runs `screencapture -l <wid>`. Stages to a temp file and refuses (exit 6) to overwrite the destination with a sub-Retina capture, or with one it cannot decode to verify. Replaces atomically via `replaceItemAt`. Also refuses (exit 7) when the window's app is not the active app before or after the capture, since an inactive window comes out with grey traffic lights and a smaller shadow. Optional `--title=<substring>` for multi-window apps, `--pid=<owner-pid>` to match only that process's windows, `--allow-low-dpi` to bypass the scale check; an unrecognized argument is an error (exit 2), not a silent no-op. |
| `scripts/filter-noise-screenshots.mjs` | Post-capture cleanup. Iterates modified PNGs in the current repo (default: under `docs/assets/screenshots/` only) or another repo (via `--root <path>`, used by `screenshot:docs-site` against the sibling docs repo). Decodes HEAD and working-tree to TIFF via `sips`, SHA-256 compares. Identical → `git restore --source=HEAD --worktree`. Visually different → kept for review. Net-new PNGs (untracked) are left alone. |
| `scripts/render-indicator-overlay.swift` | Paints a numbered step-indicator pill onto a single PNG via Core Graphics + Core Text. |
| `scripts/stitch-demo-gif.ts` | Reusable GIF stitcher. Annotates each frame via the indicator-overlay Swift helper, then encodes via two-pass ffmpeg `palettegen`/`paletteuse`. CLI: `--output`, `--frame-duration-ms`, `--no-indicator`, `--indicator-position top|bottom`. |

To produce a new multi-frame demo GIF outside the README spec:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop exec tsx \
  apps/desktop/scripts/stitch-demo-gif.ts \
  --output docs/assets/screenshots/screenshot-some-demo.gif \
  --frame-duration-ms 1500 \
  docs/assets/screenshots/some-demo-frame-1.png \
  docs/assets/screenshots/some-demo-frame-2.png \
  docs/assets/screenshots/some-demo-frame-3.png
```

Works for 2+ frames; the indicator scales horizontally with frame
count.

## Capturing ACP Protocol Transcripts

`scripts/capture-acp-transcript.mjs` drives a real ACP agent over stdio the
way `AcpAgentClient` does — same `initialize` params, `session/new`, one
`session/prompt` — and writes every JSON-RPC frame in both directions to
stdout:

```bash
node apps/desktop/scripts/capture-acp-transcript.mjs \
  --cmd ~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi --args acp \
  --cwd /tmp/acp-scratch \
  --prompt "tell me your favorite breakfast cereal" > capture.json
```

Flags: `--cmd` (required), `--args` (comma-separated), `--cwd`, `--prompt`,
`--quiet-ms` (drain window after the prompt resolves), `--timeout-ms`,
`--allow-tools`. Exit code is 0 only on a completed capture. For helper
sessions: `--session-meta <json>` (the `_meta` of `session/new`, such as a
Grok agent profile), `--config model=<id>,reasoning_effort=<level>`
(`session/set_config_option` writes before the prompt), `--deny-cancelled`
(answer permission requests `cancelled`, as a `deny-all` session does),
`--after session/close,_x.ai/session/delete` (methods called with
`{ sessionId }` after the answer), and `--list-sessions` (`session/list` for
the cwd, last).

Grok 1.0.44 findings those flags established, which a helper must respect:
`tools: []` in an agent profile means the default toolset; the MCP meta-tools
`search_tool` and `use_tool` survive an allowlist and reach the operator's own
Grok MCP servers; read-only tools run without a permission request in every
mode; and a closed session stays listed until `_x.ai/session/delete`. See
`src/main/acp/minimal-helper-session.ts`.

Reach for this whenever a question about an agent's wire behavior would
otherwise be answered by reading its source or guessing. **The committed
`__tests__/fixtures/acp-transcripts/*-build.json` fixtures cannot answer
turn-end questions** — they are normalizer-parity captures containing no
completed turn, so grepping them for usage, stop reasons, or totals returns a
confident wrong answer. That mistake is why
`kimi-code-0-31-cereal.json` exists: a full captured turn establishing that
Kimi Code 0.31.1 puts no token usage on the ACP wire.

Two things to know before running it:

- **Permission requests are denied by default.** Pass `--allow-tools` only
  when tool traffic is the point, and point `--cwd` somewhere disposable when
  you do — the harness answers on your behalf and the agent acts for real.
- **Output is raw protocol.** The operator home directory and the capture cwd
  are rewritten, but an agent can echo anything it read into a transcript.
  Read a capture before committing it as a fixture.

## Capturing Codex Account Protocol

`scripts/capture-codex-usage-protocol.ts` records a complete Codex App Server
probe without reading Codex-owned storage. It reads account, rate-limit, and
account-wide usage state; runs one isolated ephemeral structured turn with
profile tools, hooks, apps, skills, and MCP servers disabled; and reads the
same state again:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop capture:codex-usage -- \
  --codex-home /path/to/codex-profile \
  --capture-root .local/protocol-captures
```

Use this when an account type appears to expose incomplete quota or usage
information. The JSONL output contains every protocol frame and can include
account identity, local paths, prompts, and model output. Keep captures under
`.local/`, which is gitignored; never commit a raw account capture.

## Accessibility

The renderer is audited against WCAG 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 Level AA via
`apps/desktop/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`, which launches Electron under the
existing replay-fixture harness and runs `@axe-core/playwright`'s
`AxeBuilder` against each surface. CI picks it up automatically through
`pnpm run test:desktop-e2e` — no separate workflow.

Things to know when extending the audit:

- **Surface coverage.** Each `test(...)` block drives the renderer to a
  state (open thread, settings overlay, settings → messaging, the
  dedicated Star Map window, the Star Map intake dialog) and then calls
  `runAxe(window)`. Add a new block per surface you want gated; go
  through `launchAuditApp()`, which emulates reduced motion and takes an
  optional `fixturePath` / `theme`. A surface in a secondary
  BrowserWindow is a different Playwright `Page`: pass THAT page to
  `runAxe`, and re-emulate reduced motion on it — `launchAuditApp` only
  configured the main window's page.
- **Seed the fixture so the surface is actually populated.** The smoke
  fixture's thread reaches no Star Map lane — `deriveInboxState` keeps a
  first-snapshot thread out of the inbox, and an idle thread with no PR
  and no unpushed commits matches no attention category — so auditing the
  map on it would scan chrome and no cards. `e2e/fixtures/star-map/` is a
  hand-written fixture (same class as `readme-recents-hero/`) whose
  threads are `threadStatus: "active"` for exactly that reason. Check
  what your surface renders before trusting a green run.
- **Some surfaces need seeded sqlite, not a richer fixture.** The active
  sub-agents strip only renders when a thread has a non-terminal sub-agent or
  an undismissed failure, and no replay fixture produces one — every producer
  persists a `ThreadSubAgentSummary` through `upsertThreadSubAgent` into the
  `threads` payload. `e2e/fixtures/sub-agent-state-seeding.ts` writes that row
  directly (seed after launch, then `window.reload()` — the renderer does not
  re-poll on a direct sqlite mutation), the same shape the README capture
  spec's seeders use. A hand-written `threads` row encodes assumptions about
  the storage key and payload that the app can change underneath it, and a
  seeder writing a row nothing reads would leave the audit green while it
  scanned an absent surface, so `src/main/__tests__/sub-agent-state-seeding.test.ts`
  pins the round-trip in vitest.
- **Every surface is audited in every color theme.** The file wraps its
  `describe` in `for (... of AUDIT_APPEARANCES)`: the Tangerine dark and
  light pair plus each other dark theme in the dark scheme and each light
  theme in the light scheme. It threads that appearance into
  `launchAuditApp(appearance)`, so a new block is gated in all of them for
  free. This matters because contrast is the one rule class that is
  genuinely theme-dependent — roles, names, and focus order are not. The
  gate ran dark-only for its whole life, which is how three token-level
  light-theme contrast failures shipped unnoticed. Add a new color theme to
  `AUDIT_DARK_THEMES` or `AUDIT_LIGHT_THEMES`.
- **`runAxe(window, { include })` narrows the scan to one subtree.** No
  block passes it today, and it is not a tool for silencing a failure —
  everything outside the scope stops being gated. Prefer a
  `KNOWN_VIOLATIONS` entry, which waives one selector for one rule and
  leaves the rest of the surface audited. (It exists because the
  celestial-watermark blocks once scoped to `.thread-view__primary` to
  avoid measuring window-wide light-theme debt; that debt is fixed, light
  theme is gated unscoped, and those blocks folded their
  watermark-is-painted assertion into "open thread view".)
- **Reduced motion has to reach the element that animates.** The gate
  emulates `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` so it measures contrast at
  rest; a rule that zeroes the animation on the wrong selector leaves
  text mid-fade and axe reports a real-looking contrast miss. That is how
  the Star Map card rise was caught: the animation lives on
  `.star-map-card-shell`, the reduced-motion rule named `.star-map-card`.
- **`setLegacyMode(true)` is required under Electron.** The default
  `AxeBuilder.analyze()` opens a worker page via
  `browserContext.newPage()` to scan cross-origin iframes; Electron's
  CDP target returns "Not supported" for that. The renderer is
  single-origin with no cross-origin iframes, so the legacy
  single-context path covers everything we ship.
- **`KNOWN_VIOLATIONS` is a baseline, not a permission slip.** Each
  entry waives one selector for one rule with a written reason. Fix
  the underlying issue, then delete the entry — axe will hold the
  line on it going forward.
- **No raw color literals outside the token blocks** (see Implementation
  Notes below) — this is also what keeps the contrast pair audited by
  axe stable across theme + density variants.

To run the gate locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop exec playwright test \
  -c playwright.config.ts e2e/a11y.spec.ts
```

(The package's `test:e2e` script does a full Electron rebuild + Vite
build first; the `playwright test` form above skips that when you've
already built once.)

### Modal dialogs and overlays

Every `aria-modal` dialog goes through
[`useModalDialog`](src/renderer/src/lib/useModalDialog.ts). Put its ref on the
element that holds every control of the dialog. Focus then enters on open,
Tab and Shift+Tab stay inside (WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.3), Escape closes only the
topmost layer, and focus goes back to the opener on close. Before it existed,
most dialogs here had no Escape and no trap, and Tab walked into the dimmed
app behind them.

- **Do not add your own Escape or Tab listener to a dialog.** It becomes a
  second owner of the key. Traps and layers resolve one owner per keypress
  (the one holding focus, deepest first, else the newest), and a private
  listener outside that stack is how one Escape used to close a dialog and
  the find bar behind it.
- **A popup inside a dialog registers with
  [`useDismissableLayer`](src/renderer/src/lib/useDismissableLayer.ts),** or
  the dialog takes its Escape and both close. Move to Project's destination
  list (`ProjectDestinationCombobox`) is the example.
- **A claimed Escape is prevented and stopped.** A window listener that closes
  something on Escape must check `defaultPrevented`, as `ThreadFindBar` and
  the composer autocomplete do. The stop is for React handlers in a tree the
  dialog portals out of: the Star Map layer drops the card selection on any
  Escape that reaches it.
- **A busy dialog refuses in `onClose`, and the key is still claimed.** Mirror
  the disabled Cancel button; do not let Escape through to what is behind.
- **The opener is captured during render,** because `autoFocus` moves focus
  before any effect can look. A dialog opened from a menu item returns focus
  to the menu's trigger (found through `aria-controls`, or an expanded
  `aria-haspopup` beside the menu). Pass `returnFocus` where nothing marks the
  trigger, as the sidebar's context menu does.
- **`tabIndex={-1}` on the dialog element** when it is the initial focus
  (`initialFocus: "dialog"`), or when every control in it can be disabled at
  once (the Codex login dialog while the login starts). Otherwise focus stays
  behind the scrim. Give such an element `:focus { outline: none }`.
- **Chromium makes an overflowing scroller with nothing focusable in it a Tab
  stop**, though its `tabIndex` reads -1. The trap counts those; a trap that
  cannot see them wraps past them.
- **A dialog with its own Tab order passes `ownTabOrder`.** The jump palette
  steps through the active row's PR chips only; the trap still owns the key
  against a dialog beneath it and fetches stray focus back in.

Test a new dialog with `tabEscapes(dialog)` from
[`src/renderer/src/test/tab-walk.ts`](src/renderer/src/test/tab-walk.ts). It
walks 60 Tabs each way between sentinel buttons placed before and after the
page, and names every stop outside the dialog that focus reached. jsdom runs
no sequential focus navigation and has no layout, so the helper emulates the
walk and cannot see scroller stops. Check those in headless Chromium.

### Menus

A `role="menu"` goes through
[`useMenuNavigation`](src/renderer/src/lib/useMenuNavigation.ts). The role
promises the ARIA menu keyboard, and a screen-reader user told "menu" reaches
for the arrows. Focus moves to the first item on open, the arrows, Home and
End move between items, Escape closes and returns focus to the trigger, and
Tab closes and moves on from the trigger. The sidebar's menus said
`role="menu"` and did none of it: opening one left focus on the ⋮ button, and
the menu renders after the whole thread list, so Tab reached it only after
every later row.

- **The hook registers the menu with `useDismissableLayer`.** Do not add an
  Escape listener, and do not register the menu again.
- **Pass the trigger as `triggerRef`.** A menu opened by right-click has no
  button, so record whatever held focus as it opened, as `Sidebar` does with
  `rememberMenuOpener`. A dialog opened from the menu can use the same ref as
  its `returnFocus`.
- **Pass `open` only once the menu can take focus.** The sidebar's floating
  menus measure themselves at `visibility: hidden` before they are placed,
  and Chromium will not focus a hidden element. jsdom will, so only a
  headless-Chromium check catches a menu that opens too early.
- **Mark the trigger.** `aria-haspopup="menu"` plus `aria-expanded`. When the
  trigger sits in a memoized row, pass the row a boolean, not the open row's
  key, or every row re-renders on each open and close.
- **`tabIndex={-1}` on the menu** when every item in it can be disabled at
  once, as the profile menu's can. Focus then lands on the menu, where Escape
  and Tab still work.

### Selects

A single choice from a list goes through
[`Select`](src/renderer/src/components/Select.tsx), not a native `<select>`.
On macOS, Chromium hands a `<select>` to the system menu, which opens over
the control in the system font and blue highlight, and CSS cannot reach it.

- **It is the ARIA select-only combobox.** The trigger is a
  `<button role="combobox">` that keeps DOM focus while the list is open; the
  keyboard cursor is `aria-activedescendant`. A wrapping `<label>` names it,
  so `getByLabelText` still finds the field.
- **The list is portalled to `document.body`** at `z-index: 150`, above
  Settings and Automations, and registers with `useDismissableLayer`, so
  Escape inside a dialog closes the list alone. Do not add an Escape listener.
- **Tab closes without choosing.** The APG example commits on Tab. Here,
  arrowing past an option on the way out must not change the value.
- **The closed field's chrome comes from its surface,** through `className`
  or a descendant rule (`.automation-field .select-trigger`). The list cannot
  inherit type from the field, so a surface that needs it passes
  `listboxClassName`.
- **Tests drive it through [`test/select.ts`](src/renderer/src/test/select.ts).**
  `fireEvent.change` does nothing to a button. Choose by label with
  `chooseSelectOption`, read the list with `selectOptionLabels`, and read the
  stored value from `data-value`. Options exist only while the list is open,
  so waiting for `getByRole("option")` to disappear from a closed field passes
  vacuously.

## Config File Evolution

Before changing `config.toml` keys in a backwards-incompatible way, read
[../../docs/config-file-evolution.md](../../docs/config-file-evolution.md).
The desktop config writer must preserve recognized legacy shapes when possible,
mark them with the `pwragent-legacy-settings` comment, lazily convert on save,
and avoid whole-file rewrites that discard user comments.

## Explicit-Save Settings Forms

Most Settings write as they change. The few that collect edits behind a Save
button (Federation's Configuration and its manual Cloudflare edge policy) have
two rules, because the settings snapshot they render from changes constantly —
`useDesktopSettings` replaces it on **any** config write, from any section or
any window, plus on runtime-changed events.

- **Never copy the snapshot back into form state.** Federation had a
  `useEffect` on `[props.snapshot]` that re-seeded every field, so an unrelated
  write (Cloudflare Access "Connect" calls `onSettingsChanged`) silently
  reverted whatever was typed. Use
  [`useSettingsDraft`](src/renderer/src/features/settings/useSettingsDraft.ts):
  a field follows the saved value until it is edited, then holds the edit until
  it is saved or discarded. Discard the draft after a successful write — what
  is typed and what is stored can differ (`"047831"`, blank endpoint lines).
- **Tell Settings what would be lost.** Register with
  [`useUnsavedSettingsChanges`](src/renderer/src/features/settings/UnsavedSettingsChanges.tsx)
  while the form is dirty. A route that unmounts the pane — a nav item, Exit
  Settings, or anything in `App` that changes `mainView` — then asks Save /
  Discard / Keep editing first. A jump to another section of the same pane does
  not, because nothing unmounts.

**A setup step must not read another section's unsaved field.** `CloudflareSetup`
takes the *saved* listener (`props.snapshot.federation.listenPort.value`) and
says so in the Create step, because Create writes that port into Cloudflare's
tunnel: reading the Configuration form's draft once published an endpoint on a
port the operator had typed but never saved, which collided with another
profile's gateway.

Closing the window is still not guarded. Electron emits the BrowserWindow
`close` event *before* the renderer's `beforeunload`, and `close` already hands
off to the quit manager, so a `beforeunload` guard would cancel an unload
whose shutdown had begun. Quitting with unsaved Settings edits discards them.

## Thread History Persistence

Thread transcripts, rollout events, streamed message deltas, prompt text,
assistant text, and command output history must not be written into the desktop
sqlite database. Store only desktop metadata there. For the full rule and the
ACP fallback direction, read
[../../docs/thread-history-persistence.md](../../docs/thread-history-persistence.md)
before changing ACP session storage, thread replay restoration, or rollout
persistence.

## Pull-Request Status Source of Truth

There are two stores holding PR data, and they answer **different
questions**. Do not treat them as interchangeable:

- **Attachment list** — `ThreadOverlayState.prs` (sqlite `threads`
  overlay JSON, written by `setThreadPullRequests`). Authoritative for
  *which* PRs belong to a thread. The status fields on those rows are a
  cached projection and go stale by design: they are only rewritten when
  the attachment list itself is rewritten (a branch lookup).
- **Status** — the PR status registry in `DesktopAppServerService`
  (`prStatusRegistry`, durable via the `pr_status_cache` table).
  Authoritative for *what state* a PR is in. The background poller
  writes here and here only, then emits `pullRequest/status/updated`.
  It never writes back into the overlay.

**Every path that serves PR chips to a client MUST canonicalize the
overlay rows through the status registry.** The seam is the injected
`ThreadPullRequestCanonicalizer` (`setThreadPullRequestCanonicalizer`,
backed by `canonicalizeStoredPullRequests`, which loads
`pr_status_cache` first so it works before any window has driven a
lookup). Use `canonicalizeNavigationThreadPullRequests` for a navigation
snapshot's threads.

Skipping it is not a cosmetic staleness bug. `collectPrPollTargets`
drops terminal PRs from the rotation, so once a PR merges the background
poller emits no further `pullRequest/status/updated` for it — a client
served an uncanonicalized snapshot shows that PR as open with checks
running until something else happens to refresh it. (An owner-side
branch lookup still republishes terminal PRs via
`thread/pullRequests/updated`, so the row can converge if the *owner*
opens that thread — but nothing the viewer does will fix it.) This is
exactly what federation remote viewers hit: their only snapshot source
is `DesktopMessagingBackendBridge.getNavigationSnapshot`, which did not
canonicalize, while the renderer's local path did.

Canonicalization failures degrade rather than propagate:
`canonicalizeNavigationThreadPullRequests` catches, logs, and serves the
overlay rows, because possibly-stale chips beat a failed snapshot (which
for a viewer means a disconnected window).

### Who owns a PR's status when two instances can see it

A window with no federation target shows local threads and pinned remote
rows together, so the same GitHub PR can appear twice — once monitored
by the local poller, once as a peer's observation. Two monitors writing
the same rows from slightly different points in time reads as the status
flickering. The rule is **local monitoring wins, and a peer only fills a
gap it alone can see**:

- `broadcastAgentEvent` drops a remote-stamped `pullRequest/status/updated`
  before it reaches any non-federation window when
  `registry.isPullRequestLocallyMonitored(prKey)` — the PR is attached to
  a local thread's primary workspace, so our own poller owns it. The
  resolver is injected from `DesktopAppServerService` and uses the same
  test as `collectPrPollTargets`. Terminal PRs still count as ours: they
  leave the poll rotation, but our last observation of them is final.
- Federation windows always receive the event. The peer is their only
  source of truth, and their renderer-side target filter decides whether
  it belongs to the instance they front.
- When we *do* own the PR, the pinned remote row still updates — local
  `pullRequest/status/updated` matches by `prKey` across every thread in
  the snapshot, so the local observation lands on the remote row too.
  That is why dropping the peer's copy loses nothing.

`thread/pullRequests/updated` is **not** gated: a thread's *attachment
list* is owned by the instance the thread lives on, so a peer is always
authoritative for its own threads' lists. It is instead scoped by origin
in `applyThreadPullRequestsUpdate`, which matches the thread's
`federation.ref.target` against the event's, so a peer's event cannot
rewrite a local thread that happens to share an id. Do not "fix" the
asymmetry by adding this method to the gate — status and attachment
lists have different owners, and a test pins the distinction.

Two deliberate cases where we defer to the peer rather than claim
ownership, both because claiming it would assert a freshness we do not
have:

- **Non-primary attachments.** The test is the PR matching a local
  thread's *primary* repository, matching `collectPrPollTargets`. Fork
  contributions match their separate `sourceRepository`; their status key
  still belongs to the destination repository. A PR
  attached to a local thread some other way is not polled by us either,
  so the peer's observation is the fresher one.
- **Before the first local snapshot.** `attachedPrsByThreadKey` is
  populated by the local navigation-snapshot path, so until it first
  runs every PR answers "not monitored" and peer observations flow
  through. The local poller corrects any row it owns on its next
  observation.

### Transcript PR fetch trust and status ownership

- Automatic transcript/composer PR reads admit only the exact HTTPS origins
  `github.com` and `gitlab.com` in the main process. A URL in authored text is
  not authorization to send inherited CLI credentials to its host. Never
  replace this origin allowlist with GitLab URL syntax or a hostname prefix.
- Self-hosted references can still display navigation status and use explicit
  attachments. Display-only parsing must not authorize automatic fetching.
- The renderer resolves status authority per PR across all navigation rows:
  local primary-workspace attachments win, then peer observations, then other
  local attachments. Use main's `primaryGitRepository` and a contribution's
  `sourceRepository` for the local-primary check.
- Both transcript chips and composer hover cards use `useTranscriptPullRequest`.
  Peer observations suppress local subscription results in every window,
  including pinned peers in the main window. An ownership change must notify
  subscribers even if the visible PR metadata did not change.

## Thread-State Update Bus

When mutating persistent thread state (model, reasoning effort, fast mode,
permissions/execution mode, name, compaction), `BackendRegistry` MUST emit a
typed `AppServerNotification` from the mutation method on success. That
notification fans out through two existing listeners:

- **Renderer**: `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/agent-ipc.ts:broadcastAgentEvent` →
  `agent:event` IPC → `desktopApi.onAgentEvent` → `useThreadNavigation`
  patches the navigation snapshot in place.
- **Messaging controllers**: `apps/desktop/src/main/messaging/messaging-runtime.ts`
  fans the event out to every `MessagingController.handleBackendEvent`,
  which routes thread-state methods to `refreshStatusSurfacesForThread`
  to re-render every binding's status surface on its channel.

This is what keeps Telegram, Discord, and the desktop UI in sync when any
surface changes a setting. The cross-surface refresh is automatic — do
NOT add ad-hoc IPC channels or per-controller refresh fan-outs for new
thread-state fields. Instead:

1. Add the new notification method to `AppServerNotification` in
   `packages/shared/src/contracts/normalized-app-server.ts`.
2. Emit from the registry mutation method via `await this.emit(...)`.
3. Add a handler branch in `useThreadNavigation`'s `onAgentEvent`
   subscription, mirroring `applyThreadModelSettingsUpdate` /
   `applyThreadExecutionModeUpdate`.
4. Add a method-name branch in `MessagingController.handleBackendEvent`
   that routes to `refreshStatusSurfacesForThread`.

Mutation handlers in `MessagingController` (e.g. `togglePermissionsMode`)
should NOT call `renderBindingStatus` inline for state that flows through
the bus — the bus is the single source of refresh, and an inline render
would be redundant. Update binding-local preferences before the registry
call so the bus-path render sees fresh prefs.

For binding-local mutations that do NOT flow through the registry
(e.g. `cycleToolUpdateMode`, `syncConversationName`), keep the inline
`renderBindingStatus` call — there's no bus event for those.

### Permission-mode queue events

A toggle of `executionMode` while a turn is active produces additional
notifications beyond `thread/executionMode/updated`:

- `thread/executionMode/queued` — fired when the registry queues a
  pending mode change instead of applying it immediately. Params:
  `{ threadId, queuedExecutionMode, queuedAt }`. Renderer patches
  `NavigationThreadSummary.queuedExecutionMode` and shows the queue
  indicator in the composer; messaging posts an audit message in every
  bound conversation with a Cancel button.
- `thread/executionMode/queueCleared` — fired on either `cancelled`
  (user clicked Cancel) or `applied` (turn ended and the queue
  flushed). Params: `{ threadId, reason: "applied" | "cancelled" }`.
  Renderer clears the queue indicator; messaging edits the previously
  posted audit message in place (or falls back to a fresh message if
  edit fails). On `applied`, this fires AFTER `thread/executionMode/updated`
  — clients should see the apply before the queue-clear so the UI
  transitions cleanly through "queued → applying → applied".

The persistent `permissionTransitionLog` on `ThreadOverlayState` (capped
at 100 entries, sqlite-backed) is the audit trail. Renderer materializes
log entries into the transcript as synthetic activity entries with id
prefix `permission-transition-`. The queue itself (`queuedExecutionMode`,
`queuedExecutionModeAt`) lives in registry memory only and is cleared on
app restart — that's intentional, since the active turn would have been
interrupted on shutdown.

## Dependency Boundary Enforcement

**DO NOT, under any circumstances, loosen the dependency boundary rules.**

The desktop app sits at the **top** of the dependency hierarchy and may import any `@pwragent/*` package. However:

- The **renderer** (`src/renderer/`) may only import `@pwragent/shared`. All other package access must go through IPC to the main process.
- The **main process** may import any package but must not create circular dependencies.

- **DO NOT** add exceptions, allowlists, or `severity: "ignore"` overrides to `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
- **DO NOT** import provider SDKs (`grammy`, `discord.js`, `telegraf`) in `src/main/messaging/core/`
- **DO NOT** introduce circular dependencies between any modules
- If a rule blocks your change, the change is architecturally wrong — redesign it

Enforcement runs via `pnpm lint:boundaries` and fails CI on any violation.

## No Real Agent CLIs in Vitest

The `desktop-main` project loads
[`src/main/__tests__/setup/agent-cli-spawn-guard.ts`](src/main/__tests__/setup/agent-cli-spawn-guard.ts)
as a setup file. It fails any test that spawns a `codex` / `gemini` / `grok` /
`kimi` / `qwen` executable from outside the OS temp dir.

It exists because **sandboxing `PATH` does not sandbox discovery**. The ACP kit
also scans well-known `$HOME` bin dirs (`~/.local/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, every
installed nvm node bin) and each strategy's absolute fallback candidates
(`~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi`, `~/.grok/bin/grok`); Codex discovery probes its own
install locations, including the `codex` inside ChatGPT.app. Before #1740 the
suite ran ~169 real agent processes per run and asserted against whatever
versions the developer had installed.

**CI cannot catch this on its own.** CI machines have none of those binaries, so
the probe fails, discovery finds nothing, and the assertions still pass — the
tests take a different code path locally than on CI. The guard makes both the
same failure.

The hook is `ChildProcess.prototype.spawn`, not the `child_process` exports:
it is the one chokepoint every async spawn path funnels through, and a
prototype patch survives however a module imported `child_process` — including
externally bundled dependencies vitest never transforms, which `vi.mock` cannot
reach. It records **and** throws; the recording is what fails the test, because
discovery probes run inside `try/catch` and swallow a bare throw. Sync spawns
(`spawnSync` / `execFileSync`) are not covered — all agent discovery is async.

Fix a failure by injecting the seam, never by widening the guard's allowed
roots:

| Surface | Seam |
|---|---|
| ACP discovery | `listExecutables` + `fallbackRootDir` (+ `bundledGrokCommand: null`) to confine candidates to the fixture, or inject `discover` / `readVersionOutput` |
| Codex discovery | inject `codexDiscoveryCoordinator`, or `vi.mock("@pwrdrvr/codex-discovery")` via [`__tests__/helpers/codex-discovery-stub.ts`](src/main/__tests__/helpers/codex-discovery-stub.ts) |
| Anything else | `vi.mock` the discovery module, as `settings-ipc` and `backend-registry` already do |

`acp-runtime-override-launch.test.ts` is the worked example of the ACP seams,
and `acp-instance-discovery.test.ts` of plain probe injection.

## No Network and No Operator State in Vitest

Two more suite-wide guards, both pure test infrastructure. Production code has
no test-awareness and behaves identically either way — the seams are in
`vitest.workspace.ts`.

**Where.** Both desktop projects set `PWRAGENT_HOME` to
`<os.tmpdir()>/pwragent-vitest-home-<pid>`. `resolvePwragentRoot` otherwise
falls back to `~/.pwragent`, and only about a dozen main tests override it
themselves, so every other test that touches a root-relative path was reading
and writing the operator's live application state. A plain `pnpm test` really
did install a ~353 MB Grok runtime into `~/.pwragent/agents/grok/`, and the
suite still writes a scratch projects directory and `state/image-inputs` —
those now land in the temp root.

Nothing pre-creates the directory, so a well-behaved run leaves no trace at
all; anything that appears there is a test writing to the PwrAgent root. The
pid keeps concurrent runs (several worktrees testing at once is normal) off
each other's state. A test that needs its own root still wins with `vi.stubEnv`
or an explicit `env` argument. `__tests__/disposable-pwragent-home.test.ts`
pins both halves — that each project still declares the redirect, and that the
value actually reaches a forked worker — so a config edit cannot quietly drop
it. The one root path it does not cover is `userHomeWorktreesRoot`, which is
deliberately `os.homedir()`-anchored; no test has ever created it, and
`git-directory-service` takes an injected `homeDir`.

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME` travel with it, pinned to
`<os.tmpdir()>/pwragent-vitest-xdg-<pid>/{config,state}` on both projects and
guarded by the same test. Nothing in the app reads them today; the pre-profile
migration that searched them for `pwragnt/` state is gone. They stay because
`PWRAGENT_HOME` never covered them: those roots came from `os.homedir()` and
the ambient XDG variables, so a test that stubbed only the PwrAgent root still
read the operator's real `~/.config` and `~/.local/state` — and a developer
carrying pre-1.0 files then ran a different code path than CI on every
`initializeAppState`. Set all three together when a suite needs its own roots.

**Whether.** [`src/test-setup/outbound-fetch-guard.ts`](src/test-setup/outbound-fetch-guard.ts)
replaces `globalThis.fetch` and fails any test that makes a real outbound
request. It hooks the global rather than taking an injected `fetch` per caller
for the same reason the spawn guard hooks a prototype: it is the one chokepoint
every request funnels through, so it also covers `acp-registry-service`,
`mcp-connection-gateway-service`, and `auto-updater` — none of which were given a
seam — plus any network path added later. Injection is how you *fix* a failure
(`fetchLatestCompatibleRelease` honors `options.fetch`, and
`grok-managed-runtime.test.ts` passes one); it cannot be what enforces the
rule, because a module with no seam is exactly the case that needs catching.

Like the spawn guard it records **and** throws — every one of these callers
degrades to a cached value or a logged warning inside its own `try`/`catch`, so
a bare throw would be swallowed and the test would pass green having attempted
the request anyway. Unlike the spawn guard's prototype patch, the global is
routinely replaced by tests, so the guard reinstalls itself on every setup run
rather than once per worker; a test that drives its own fake HTTP layer
replaces it for its own duration, as `auto-updater.test.ts` does. Not covered:
`http.request` / `https.request` / `net.connect`, which Node's undici `fetch`
does not route through and nothing here uses directly.

**Loopback goes through.** `localhost` (and any `*.localhost`),
`127.0.0.0/8` — including the `::ffff:127.0.0.1` form a dual-stack socket
reports — `::1`, and the wildcard bind addresses `0.0.0.0` / `::` cannot leave
the machine, so they are not what the guard is for: that is a test talking to a
server it started, the same category as the spawn guard's `os.tmpdir()`
allowance. `agent-tool-mcp-server.test.ts` drives its MCP server's real HTTP
surface (auth, CORS, thread binding) exactly this way. A scheme that opens no
socket at all — `data:`, `blob:`, `file:` — is allowed for the same reason;
those have no host to classify, and reading an inline fixture is not egress.
The allowance is pinned by the self-test, including that a remote host merely
*containing* "localhost" is still blocked.

The renderer project loads the fetch guard too. It has no `fetch` call site
today and reaches the network through IPC, but `lint:boundaries` reads imports
and cannot see a `globalThis.fetch`, and jsdom inherits a live one from Node —
so this is the only thing here that would catch a renderer reaching a remote
host directly. A relative URL is resolved against the document origin before it
is classified, so a same-origin renderer fetch is allowed through as loopback;
the guard measures egress, not same-origin. Node has no `location`, so the same
input there stays unparseable and is treated as escaping.

`__tests__/outbound-fetch-guard.test.ts` is the guard's self-test, in the same
shape as `agent-cli-spawn-guard.test.ts`;
`renderer/src/test/outbound-fetch-guard.test.ts` covers the one case that needs
a document origin.

## Sqlite Write-Volume Instrumentation

PR #1406 fixed tool accounting running one implicit transaction per streamed
8 KiB command-output chunk: **3,693 commits and 58 MB of WAL growth** for a
single `find /`, to persist about nineteen integer counters. The whole suite
passed either way. It had to be found by hand.

The reason nothing caught it is worth internalizing before you reach for a
unit test here: **the main-process suites mock the overlay store.**
`backend-registry.test.ts` alone constructs `createOverlayStoreMock` in 450+
places, so no sqlite is involved and no assertion about write behavior is
possible. The code path that writes for real only runs in the app — which the
E2E harness does exercise, against a real `state.db` under a temp
`PWRAGENT_HOME`.

So the instrumentation lives on the database, in
[`src/main/state/sqlite-write-metrics.ts`](src/main/state/sqlite-write-metrics.ts),
and covers vitest, E2E, and dev runs from one place.

**Measure commits, not statements.** Each implicit transaction flushes its
dirty pages, and a row update drags along every index it moved — in #1406's
case four 4 KB pages per write, because `observed_at` sits in all three
indexes on `thread_tool_invocations`. Ranking by statements would call a
batched migration expensive and a per-event write loop cheap.

### Running it

```bash
pnpm test:sqlite-writes                       # whole suite, then the ranking
pnpm test:sqlite-writes apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/state-db.test.ts
```

Every desktop E2E run reports automatically — the harness is the only place
the real write path executes, the overhead is a `statSync` per commit against
a run that launches Electron, and the ranking prints at teardown into the run
log (`e2e.log` on the lab guest). Opt out with
`PWRAGENT_DEV_SQLITE_WRITE_METRICS=0`.

### Things that will bite you

- **Attach after migrations, not before.** Schema migrations commit once per
  version on a fresh database. A suite that opens a temp db per test would
  otherwise rank whichever file opened the most databases as the heaviest
  writer — the first version of this reported 164 commits for 16 statements.
- **Instrumentation must be invisible to the code it measures.**
  better-sqlite3 hangs `.default` / `.deferred` / `.immediate` / `.exclusive`
  off the callable `transaction()` returns, and they are **not enumerable**.
  Copying with `Object.assign` drops them and every `tx.immediate(...)` caller
  dies with "is not a function"; `pr-auto-dispatch.test.ts` is what caught it.
- **A zero is not a clean bill of health.** A test file that mocks its store
  reports zero writes no matter what it does in production. Read the ranking
  as "of the code that touched real sqlite, here is the order", never as
  coverage.

### Known baselines

Numbers to compare a new write path against, all measured with this harness:

| Path | Cost |
|---|---|
| Streamed command output, per-chunk (pre-#1406) | 3,693 commits / 58 MB WAL for one `find /` |
| Streamed command output, coalesced (today) | 34 commits / 0.54 MB for the same command |
| Former 10-second runtime lease heartbeats | 720 commits / 2.7 MB per hour (~65 MB/day) |
| PID-owned messaging + federation leases, idle hour | 0 commits / 0 MB WAL |
| PID-owned lease lifecycle (register, acquire/release both, exit) | 6 commits / ~93 KB WAL |
| PID-owned dead-owner observation + takeover, both leases | 5 commits / ~72 KB WAL |
| Whole vitest suite | 51 sources / ~3,000 commits / ~27 MB WAL |
| One replay E2E spec | ~28 commits across two Electron processes |

The former idle figure came from two 10-second sqlite renewal loops. Runtime
leases now register one process identity and verify its PID, instance ID, and
start time against the existing profile runtime marker only when a challenger
tries to acquire messaging or federation. A confirmed dead-owner observation
is persisted and becomes reclaimable after one minute, even if the PID is
reused in the meantime. Holding either lease adds no sqlite timer and no idle
sqlite writes. A process that is alive but hung retains ownership while its
profile marker remains fresh; this deliberately favors preventing dual owners
over preempting a possibly healthy process.

### Write budgets

[`src/main/__tests__/fixtures/sqlite-write-budgets.json`](src/main/__tests__/fixtures/sqlite-write-budgets.json)
records what each measured scenario costs, and
`sqlite-write-metrics.test.ts` fails when one moves:

```
sqlite write budget "streamed-command-output" changed.
  budget:   2 commits, 2 statements, 2 rows (~36 KB WAL)
  measured: 501 commits, 501 statements, 501 rows (~2820 KB WAL)
```

That is the pre-#1406 write pattern being caught automatically. Note the
budget: **2 commits for 501 streamed events**, because commits must not scale
with events.

**Setup is excluded by construction.** `measureSqliteWrites(fn)` measures only
what the callback does, so opening the database, applying migrations, and
seeding fixtures all sit outside it. A budget therefore tracks the feature and
stays put when a test grows more setup — no classifying writes after the fact,
no arguing about which INSERT was "arrange".

**Only the deterministic counters are asserted.** Commits, write statements,
and rows changed are a pure function of the code path — same operations, same
numbers, on any machine under any load, which is what makes an exact assertion
safe here rather than a tolerance. WAL bytes are *not* deterministic (page fill
and checkpoint timing move them run to run), so `observedWalBytes` is recorded
for humans to read and never asserted. Commits are the honest proxy for volume.

Deviation fails in **both** directions. An increase is the regression this
exists to catch; a decrease means the budget has gone stale and would stop
catching anything, so lowering it is a deliberate act.

### Adding a budget

Any new write path that fires per command, per turn, per item, per streamed
event, or on a timer gets one. Wrap the feature — not its setup — and name the
scenario:

```ts
const { writes } = await measureSqliteWrites(async () => {
  // drive the feature
});
expectSqliteWriteBudget({
  note: "what one unit of work is, in words",
  scenario: "my-feature",
  writes,
});
```

Then record it with `UPDATE_SQLITE_WRITE_BUDGETS=1 pnpm test <file>` and commit
the JSON. Re-record the same way when a change moves a number **on purpose**,
and say why in the commit message — the point of the file is that a write-cost
change shows up as a reviewable line in a diff instead of never showing up at
all.

Before recording, do the projection: writes/second × how long a real session
runs → MB/day. If it looks excessive, raise it rather than baking it in. A
budget is a record of what a path costs, not permission for it to cost that.

## SQLite Query Rules

- Never interpolate user-sourced values into SQL strings. Always use
  `better-sqlite3` prepared statements with positional or named bindings.
- Messaging-platform inbound text is the highest-risk SQLite input category:
  public Telegram, Discord, Mattermost, Slack, Signal, Feishu, and future
  adapter traffic must be treated as hostile even when the local desktop user
  trusts the bound thread.
- Generated SQL fragments are only allowed for non-data structure, such as a
  generated `?, ?, ?` placeholder list. Hardcoded maintenance table names must
  stay allowlisted by the SQL-template lint guard.
- Run `pnpm lint:sql` after changing desktop main-process SQLite code. It flags
  interpolated SQL template strings in the messaging/state persistence surface.

## Implementation Notes

- Centralize visual tokens in `styles/app.css` before expanding renderer surfaces.
- **No raw color literals outside `:root` / `:root[data-theme="..."]`.** All
  hex / rgb / hsl / `color-mix(in srgb, #..., ...)` constants belong in the
  token blocks at the top of `styles/app.css`. Use `var(--token)` everywhere
  else. The renderer ships light and dark themes via `data-theme` attribute
  selectors plus a synchronous pre-React bootstrap in `index.html` — any new
  raw color literal in a component rule (or further down in `app.css`) will
  not flip with the theme and is a regression. Derived alpha overlays should
  use `color-mix(in srgb, var(--token) <pct>%, transparent)` so they
  automatically follow the token in every theme.
- **Theme + density source of truth is per-profile `config.toml`
  `[general.appearance]`.** The full path: main process
  `readBootstrapAppearance` (sync TOML read in
  `src/main/settings/appearance-bootstrap.ts`) → BrowserWindow
  `webPreferences.additionalArguments` → preload
  `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("__pwragentAppearance", …)` → inline
  `<script>` in `src/renderer/index.html` sets `<html data-theme/data-density>`
  before any React code runs. The renderer's `useAppearance` hook adopts
  the snapshot value when it arrives over IPC and writes changes back via
  `writeSettingsConfig({ general: { appearance: { theme, density } } })`.
  The hook lifts to `App.tsx` and threads the controller down — instantiate
  it once per window so the React state is consistent. Do not reintroduce
  localStorage as a persistence layer; TOML is authoritative across all
  windows and profiles.
- Reuse shell primitives instead of adding one-off page styling.
- When in doubt, make the interface calmer, denser, and more editorial.
- For tooltips inside clipped or layered surfaces (sidebar, scroll regions,
  overflow-hidden chips, draggable rails, or anything that must escape the
  left bar), use `src/renderer/src/lib/useViewportTooltip.tsx` with the
  shared `.viewport-tooltip` class. CSS pseudo-element tooltips
  (`tooltip-target` + `data-tooltip`) are only for elements whose ancestors
  all render with `overflow: visible`; otherwise they get clipped or lose
  z-order fights against the main surface.
  - **Structured hover cards pass their own class instead of
    `.viewport-tooltip`.** The hook takes a `ReactNode`, so a card with
    sections and meters (`.context-usage-card`, `.pr-status-card`) styles
    itself; keep new ones on those two's measurements so the app's hover
    cards stay one family. Plain text tooltips keep `.viewport-tooltip`.
  - **Check the layer your trigger lives in.** The portal renders on
    `document.body`, and `.app-shell` opens no stacking context, so
    full-window layers (Settings at `z-index: 120`) sit in the same root
    stacking context and will paint OVER a tooltip left at the default
    90. Anything reachable from those surfaces needs an explicit higher
    layer — see `.messaging-status-tooltip` and `.pr-status-card`. The
    dedicated Star Map window has the same shape: `.star-map-window`
    opens a stacking context that scopes the card z-scale, so its portal
    tooltips (`.star-map-card__tooltip`) also carry an explicit layer.
  - **A card with content worth hearing needs `aria-describedby`.** Point the
    trigger at the hook's `tooltipId` while `visible`; nothing else references
    the portal, so an unwired card is sighted-only. Do not solve this by
    stuffing the data into the trigger's `aria-label` — that changes the
    control's name, not its description.
- Use the project-local [desktop E2E fixture seeding skill](../../.agents/skills/desktop-e2e-fixture-seeding/SKILL.md) when capturing or refreshing replay-backed desktop E2E fixtures.

## Third-Party Brand Assets

- Vendor-supplied brand assets (logos, marks, icons) live under `src/renderer/src/assets/<vendor>/` as **files from the vendor's official brand kit** — never hand-redrawn, recolored, cropped, or padded. A mechanical, scripted resize of the vendor's own artwork is the one transformation allowed, and only when the asset's `README.md` records it and a script reproduces it; see the PwrSuite sister marks below.
- Each asset directory MUST include a `README.md` documenting: the source URL, the vendor's usage rules, and the procedure for re-fetching on update. See [`src/renderer/src/assets/mattermost/README.md`](src/renderer/src/assets/mattermost/README.md) as the reference example.
- Render verbatim assets via `<img>`, NOT inline `<svg>` with `currentColor`. The `<img>` tag is structurally insulated from parent CSS `color` rules, which protects the asset from accidental recoloring.
- Do not add hand-drawn `currentColor` vendor silhouettes. If a platform has a recognizable mark, follow the Mattermost/Telegram/Discord pattern instead.

### An app's mark outside macOS comes from `build/icon.png`

Every PwrSuite app builds its macOS icon from an Icon Composer package
(`build/icon.icon`), and `actool` derives a legacy `.icns` from it at package
time. **Neither is the mark to use anywhere else.** Every member of that
`.icns`, and the `build/icon-macos.png` beside it, is padded to Apple's
824-in-1024 safe-area template — the plate covers 80% of its canvas.

For any non-macOS context — a web page, a favicon, a cross-app brand mark in
another app's UI — use **`apps/desktop/build/icon.png`**, the full-bleed master
each repo already keeps as its Windows/Linux source. That is what PwrAgent
serves for its own mark on the OAuth callback page, and what
[`scripts/sync-pwrsuite-brand-icon.mjs`](scripts/sync-pwrsuite-brand-icon.mjs)
copies from a sister checkout.

Getting this wrong does not look like a bug in the asset — it looks like a
layout problem on whatever surface drew it, and the local fix is to scale the
mark back up in CSS. PwrAgent carried that compensation at three draw sites
across two stylesheets before the assets were re-sourced, and the second one
was added months after the first by someone looking at one small mark. If a
mark paints at 80% of what is beside it, re-source the asset.

## Quit Retries

A quit that a `before-quit` listener defers is re-issued from a macrotask,
through `retryQuitAfterDispatch` in
[`src/main/quit-retry.ts`](src/main/quit-retry.ts). That includes an
`app.quit()` the quit manager runs synchronously while the listener is still
on the stack. Never call `app.quit()` from the listener itself or from a
promise chain that can settle in microtasks.

- Electron 41's `Browser::Quit()` assigns `is_quitting_` after the
  before-quit emit returns. An emit that starts from a native task (Dock →
  Quit, logout, Electron's own SIGTERM handling) runs a microtask checkpoint
  before that assignment, so a nested pass's quit is overwritten. The windows
  close, Electron emits `window-all-closed` instead of `will-quit`, and the
  process can stay alive with no windows. PwrSnap shipped that stall in
  pwrdrvr/PwrSnap#659 and fixed it in pwrdrvr/PwrSnap#677.
- Here the `window-all-closed` handler re-issues the quit after resource
  shutdown completes, which hid the lost pass. It is not a substitute: it
  stands down during an update install, and a pass that skipped resource
  shutdown never satisfies it.
- `menu.ts` quits through a click handler, and the main process installs its
  own SIGTERM handler, so neither ⌘Q nor a signal reaches `before-quit` from a
  native task. Dock → Quit and a logout still do.
- Playwright E2E quits from JS, which never nests, so E2E cannot catch this.
  The "under a native quit" tests in `__tests__/index.test.ts` run the real
  handlers through
  [`__tests__/helpers/electron-quit-model.ts`](src/main/__tests__/helpers/electron-quit-model.ts).
  `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop probe:quit-reentry` checks that model
  against the shipped Electron with hidden windows. Re-run it on an Electron
  major bump.

## Worktree Path Computation

- **All worktree paths** must use the shared `computeWorktreePath` from `src/main/app-server/git-directory-service.ts`.
- There are two code paths that create worktrees: `prepareLaunchpadWorkspace` (in `git-directory-service.ts`) and `handoffLocalToWorktree` / `handoffLocalChangesToDetachedWorktree` (in `git-workspace-handoff-service.ts`). Both must use the same path builder.
- The naming pattern is `<root>/<hash>/<project-folder-name>` where `<hash>` is `Date.now().toString(36)` and `<project-folder-name>` is `path.basename(repoRoot)` preserving original casing.
- Do not introduce additional worktree path builders — centralize in `computeWorktreePath`.

## Release Notes

- The first signed v1.x build is signed under the PwrDrvr LLC Developer ID
  (Team ID `T44CNHC4UH`) with bundle id `com.pwrdrvr.pwragent`. macOS Keychain
  scopes `safeStorage` keys by signing identity + bundle id, so any pre-v1.0
  development build's encrypted secrets at
  `~/.local/state/pwragent/settings-secrets.json` (Telegram / Discord bot
  tokens) WILL fail to decrypt under the new signed build. The
  `desktop-secret-store` returns `undefined` on decrypt failure and prompts the
  user to re-enter the secret in Settings — no crash, no stale ciphertext
  re-used as plaintext. Document this in v1.0.0 release notes for any internal
  testers upgrading from pre-v1.0 dev builds.
- Hardcoded version strings in shipped code are an anti-pattern. Always use
  `app.getVersion()` (main process) or `desktopApi.readAppMetadata()` (renderer)
  so every release reports its real version.
