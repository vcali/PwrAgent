// Renderer accessibility gate. Runs axe-core via @axe-core/playwright
// against a handful of high-traffic UI surfaces inside a real Electron
// launch (the same fixture/replay harness every other e2e spec uses),
// and asserts zero WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 AA violations.
//
// We intentionally use the actual Electron renderer (not a jsdom render
// of individual components) so that real styling from app.css — focus
// rings, contrast, sticky-header layout — gets audited as it actually
// ships. Surfaces that share a fixture and theme reuse one Electron
// launch, with named steps and explicit state resets keeping failures
// attributable and preventing overlays from leaking into the next scan.
// The coverage is what a screen-reader / keyboard-only operator actually
// encounters.
//
// To extend: add a named `test.step(...)` to the matching fixture group,
// or add a grouped `test(...)` when the surface needs a different fixture.
// Drive the renderer into the state, call `runAxe(window, surface)`, and
// reset any stateful layer before the next step. Launch via
// `launchAuditApp({ theme })` so every surface is audited at rest (see below).
//
// Every surface is audited in BOTH themes. The gate ran dark-only for
// its whole life, which is exactly why three light-theme token-level
// contrast failures shipped unnoticed: `--accent` at 4.20:1 on the
// sidebar wordmark, `--accent-bright` at 3.17:1 on the active lens tab,
// and `--text-muted` at 4.23:1 on the .context-grid thread-info labels.
// Contrast is the one rule class that is genuinely theme-dependent —
// roles, names, and focus order are not — so auditing a single theme
// buys roughly half the coverage it appears to.
