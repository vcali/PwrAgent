 * Everywhere else the harness relies on `HOME`: `resolvePwragentRoot` falls
 * back to `os.homedir()`, which on POSIX honors `HOME`, so the app lands in
 * the same `<homeRoot>/.pwragent` that `resolveSeedConfigPath` seeds. On
 * Windows `os.homedir()` reads `USERPROFILE` and ignores `HOME` outright, so
 * the launched app read `C:\Users\<runner>\.pwragent` instead, found no
 * profile, and dropped into the first-run wizard — whose modal scrim then
 * swallowed the spec's first click. Playwright reports that as a bare test
 * timeout with no call log: 73 of them on this suite's first Windows run,
 * against zero on Linux and macOS.
 *
 * `PWRAGENT_HOME` rather than a mirrored `USERPROFILE`. The env var is the
 * root override this project documents for exactly this case, it outranks
 * `os.homedir()` in `resolvePwragentRoot` instead of racing it, and it moves
 * only PwrAgent's own root. Repointing `USERPROFILE` moves the home every
 * Windows library derives paths from, and the desktop app died on the runner
 * before it wrote a line of stderr when this harness tried it.
 *
 * Scoped to win32 so POSIX keeps resolving through `HOME` exactly as before,
 * and skipped when a spec set its own — `onboarding-wizard.spec.ts` drives
 * these resolvers deliberately. The seed follows along on its own:
 * `resolveSeedConfigPath` reads `PWRAGENT_HOME` from this same environment
 * first, so it and the app agree, which is what the pre-flight
 * `assertOnboardingSeedTook` could not otherwise prove.
