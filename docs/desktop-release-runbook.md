# Desktop Release Runbook

> MIT-licensed desktop release pipeline.

This runbook covers cutting v1.x desktop releases. macOS releases ship as
Apple Silicon (arm64) and universal Apple Silicon + Intel binaries; distribution is outside the Mac App
Store via signed/notarized DMG with auto-update through `electron-updater`
against GitHub Releases on `pwrdrvr/PwrAgent`. Linux releases ship as manual
Debian packages for x64/amd64 and arm64.

---

## macOS architecture contract

`release.mjs` defaults to universal, preserving local and preview workflows.
Pass `--mac-arch=arm64` to prepare/package the Apple Silicon build. Its stage
is `apps/desktop/release-stage-arm64/`; universal remains `release-stage/`.
CI prepares both before the protected signing job and signs/notarizes each.
The Dock plug-in, Electron, SQLite, node-pty, canvas and ripgrep use the target
architecture. Universal keeps both canvas platform packages; arm64 omits Intel.

Stage Grok with `stage-grok-bundle.mjs --platform macos-aarch64` before preparing
arm64. If the pinned release's asset list includes the corresponding
`-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`, staging requires its SHA256SUMS entry, downloads and
verifies it. An absent asset uses that same pinned release's universal asset.
A present asset with a missing/bad checksum fails. API, download, checksum or
architecture failures do not trigger fallback. No runtime version floats to latest: a newly
published Grok release becomes available by updating `grok-bundle.json`'s pin.
This fallback intentionally leaves universal Grok inside an arm64 app until
upstream supplies the smaller signed artifact. Managed Grok updates remain
universal for now; this change only selects the runtime bundled in the app.

After both package commands, run:

```bash
node apps/desktop/scripts/assemble-mac-release.mjs \
  apps/desktop/release-stage/dist apps/desktop/release-stage-arm64/dist
```

Assembly checks each ZIP's SHA-512, size, version and architecture-specific
name, requires both blockmaps and DMGs, and writes one `latest-mac.yml` into
the universal dist. Its `files` contains universal then arm64; legacy `path`
and `sha512` still describe universal. Do not upload the arm64 stage's manifest
separately. Both ZIPs retain their own `.blockmap`. The macOS checksum manifest
is `PwrAgent-macos-SHA256SUMS`, including both stable DMG aliases.

Keep existing versioned universal names and the `PwrAgent.dmg` alias forever.
New names are `PwrAgent-${version}-arm64.dmg`,
`PwrAgent-${version}-arm64-mac.zip`, and `PwrAgent-arm64.dmg`.
The pinned electron-updater 6.8.9 chooses arm64 ZIPs on Apple Silicon (including
Rosetta) and universal ZIPs on Intel from the existing `latest-mac.yml` URL.
Older universal-only release feeds remain usable. Allow a full ZIP download
on the first architecture transition because an older arm64 blockmap may not
exist. Verify signed upgrade/relaunch on Apple Silicon, Rosetta and Intel
before promoting the first paired release; unit routing checks do not prove
Squirrel installation or notarization succeeds.

Before promotion, confirm both targets and aliases are attached. The README's
Apple Silicon link uses the latest release page during rollout so it does not
point at an absent stable alias. Once the first paired stable release is
promoted, it can link directly to `releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-arm64.dmg`.
The website change belongs in `pwrdrvr/pwragent.ai`: add both choices and use
high-entropy architecture hints only when available, with universal as the
unknown/no-JavaScript fallback. Do not infer architecture from “Intel Mac OS X”
in the UA string. Keep separate size badges for each artifact.

### Paired build size baseline

The 2026-09-11 unsigned alpha.5 build rehearsal (same source for both targets,
including PR #2069's SQLite source exclusion) measured:

| Output | Universal bytes | Apple Silicon bytes | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Installed regular files, excluding symlinks | 1,011,399,701 | 752,966,865 | 25.55% |
| Updater ZIP | 377,064,050 | 269,880,597 | 28.43% |
| DMG | 389,834,137 | 279,235,131 | 28.37% |

This build retained universal Grok from the existing pin. The arm64 package
contained only the arm64 canvas binding. Both dry-run packages, archive
assembly, and merged updater metadata passed. The new upstream arm64 Grok
package is tracked in [grok-build PR #13](https://github.com/pwrdrvr/grok-build/pull/13);
the signed `pwragent-v1.0.24-pwragent.2` release now supplies that asset and
`grok-bundle.json` pins it for all platforms. Its arm64 archive is 70,436,351
bytes versus 145,538,128 bytes for universal. The checksum, arm64-only Mach-O
and PwrDrvr Developer ID signature were verified before packaging. The table
above records the earlier universal-Grok fallback rehearsal, not this new pin
or signed-release measurements.

With the new Grok pin, a second paired dry-run build measured:

| Output | Universal bytes | Apple Silicon bytes | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Installed regular files, excluding symlinks | 1,042,140,897 | 588,902,297 | 43.49% |
| Updater ZIP | 389,852,650 | 210,232,734 | 46.07% |
| DMG | 402,947,119 | 217,516,484 | 46.02% |

Packaged Grok reports `1.0.24-pwragent.2` in both targets. Its arm64 executable
is 182,241,968 bytes and arm64-only; the universal executable is 377,047,728
bytes with both slices. Both embedded provenance manifests reference the new
pin and expected asset hashes. Upstream Developer ID verification, both
package commands, merged updater assembly, and all assembled SHA256SUMS
entries passed. These app builds used ad-hoc dry-run signing; protected app
signing/notarization and real update/relaunch smoke tests remain required.

## One-time setup

These steps need to happen exactly once. They are tracked in the v1.0 release
packaging plan as Phase A.

1. **Apple Developer Program enrollment** for PwrDrvr LLC.
   - Already done. Team ID: **`T44CNHC4UH`**. Team Name: `PwrDrvr LLC`.
2. **Developer ID Application certificate**.
   - Generated in Apple Developer portal → Certificates.
   - Imported into the dev Mac's Keychain.
   - Verify with:
     ```bash
     security find-identity -v -p codesigning
     # expect exactly: "Developer ID Application: PwrDrvr LLC (T44CNHC4UH)"
     ```
   - Exported as a password-protected `.p12` and stored in 1Password.
3. **App Store Connect API key** for notarization.
   - Created in App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → Keys
     with the **Developer** role (least privilege that can notarize).
   - Downloaded the `.p8` file (one-time).
   - Stored in 1Password alongside the Key ID and Issuer ID.
4. **GitHub `apple-signing` Environment**.
   - Create the `apple-signing` environment in `pwrdrvr/PwrAgent`.
   - Add required reviewers and limit approval to **`huntharo`**.
   - Limit the environment to protected release refs/tags when GitHub's
     environment controls allow it.
   - Store the Apple signing/notarization secrets on this environment, not as
     repository secrets:
     - `CSC_LINK` — `.p12` base64-encoded
     - `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` — the `.p12` password
     - `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64` — `.p8` base64-encoded
     - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` — the Key ID
     - `APPLE_API_ISSUER` — the Issuer ID
   - Optional publish secret, also environment-scoped if used:
     `RELEASES_PAT` — fine-grained PAT scoped to `Contents: Read & Write` on
     `pwrdrvr/PwrAgent`. The workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` if absent.
5. **GitHub repository secrets**.
   - Do **not** keep Apple signing/notarization material as repository secrets
     after the `apple-signing` environment secrets are configured.
   - Non-release CI secrets, such as live smoke-test service keys, may remain as
     repository secrets if their workflows require them.

`APPLE_TEAM_ID` is hardcoded in `.github/workflows/release.yml` to `T44CNHC4UH`
since it is not a secret.

## Release trains and maintenance branches

`main` remains the active `N.N` release train through alpha and beta candidates,
the first `vN.N.0` stable release, and follow-up `vN.N.P` releases. Long-lived
maintenance branches are named `releases/<major>.<minor>`, for example
`releases/1.0` or `releases/1.1`; do not include the patch component in the
branch name.

Cut `releases/N.N` only when the product owner explicitly decides to start the
next major/minor train on `main`. Do not create a release branch merely to
promote an accepted beta to its suffix-free stable release. At the time of that
decision, branch from the then-current `main` commit: it may deliberately
include post-release fixes or enhancements beyond the first stable tag. Then
bump `main` to the next alpha train.

After the cut, maintenance candidates and patch releases land on their train
branch:

```bash
# v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 land on releases/1.0.
git switch releases/1.0
```

Until that cut, the current train's prerelease, first stable, and follow-up
patch releases all land on `main`:

```bash
# v1.1.0-beta.1, v1.1.0, and v1.1.1 land on main.
git switch main
```

For example, only after the owner directs the `1.2` transition should you cut
`releases/1.1` from current `main`, then bump `main` to `1.2.0-alpha.1`.

CI runs for pushes to `main` and `releases/**`, and pull requests targeting
maintenance branches use the same PR workflow as `main`. Release workflow fixes
are always valid backport candidates for supported maintenance branches so old
trains do not lose the ability to ship security patches.

Desktop Settings let operators pick a **channel** (Stable or Beta) and a
**track** (Latest or Prerelease). Tag suffixes map onto those four slots:

| Settings slot | Tag | GitHub flag |
|---|---|---|
| Stable · Latest | `v1.0.5` | Latest (after promotion) |
| Stable · Prerelease | `v1.0.6-prerelease.1` | Pre-release |
| Beta · Latest | `v1.1.0-beta.3` | Pre-release |
| Beta · Prerelease | `v1.1.0-alpha.7` | Pre-release |

CI publishes **every** release as a GitHub `Pre-release`, including a
suffix-free stable tag. A suffix-free tag left at `prerelease: true` lands in
Stable · Prerelease, so Stable · Latest keeps serving the previous stable
release until an operator promotes the new one. See
[Promoting a release to Latest](#promoting-a-release-to-latest).

Use `-prerelease.N` for Stable RCs. Use `-alpha.N` / `-beta.N` on `main`.
Every `main` tag with a prerelease suffix must stay a GitHub Pre-release so
it cannot steal `/releases/latest` from the Stable train. Promote a smoked
alpha by bumping `apps/desktop/package.json` and the CHANGELOG heading to
the beta version, then tagging that commit. Do not retag the alpha SHA.

**The suffix is load-bearing, not just the GitHub flag.** Stable · Latest
resolves to the highest *suffix-free* non-prerelease tag, so a tag carrying
`-alpha.N` / `-beta.N` / `-prerelease.N` can never become the feed every
Stable operator is pushed onto — even if someone forgets the Pre-release
checkbox at tag time. A mistagged `main` tag fails **closed**: it lands in no
slot at all, and the Beta rows in Settings read "Unavailable" until the flag
is corrected on the GitHub release. That is the symptom to look for after a
`main` tag if Beta operators report seeing nothing new. The fallback to a
suffixed tag applies only to a release set with no suffix-free stable at all
(the pre-`v1.0.0` world, where every stable was a `v1.0.0-beta.N` published as
GitHub Latest).

## Cutting a release (CI path — preferred)

Before editing release metadata, run `pnpm release:channels --audit` and follow
the [package-manager distribution preflight](package-manager-distribution.md).
Every release, including alpha/beta candidates, records authoritative Homebrew
and Winget versions, pending submissions and blockers. Stable package entries
change only after a suffix-free release is promoted.

The channel preflight and public manifest generation use the organization's
public-read-only `DISTRIBUTION_READ_TOKEN`, with `github.token` fallback for
fork checks. Confirm repository access from secret metadata, expiration and
rotation readiness with the organization owner, and successful remote reads.
Follow the linked runbook for bounded throttling retries and incomplete searches;
neither condition proves absence. This secret is separate from submission write
credentials and must never be printed or copied.

```bash
# 1. Bump the desktop version and add a matching top CHANGELOG.md entry.
# Treat apps/desktop/package.json as the release version source.
RELEASE_BRANCH=main
RELEASE_TAG=v1.0.0-alpha.7 pnpm release:check
pnpm licenses:generate
pnpm licenses:check

# 2. Commit the release metadata and land it on the release branch.
# Preferred: direct signed push by a maintainer with branch-protection bypass.
git add apps/desktop/package.json CHANGELOG.md THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES
git commit -S -m "chore(release): prepare v1.0.0-alpha.7"
git push origin HEAD:$RELEASE_BRANCH

# 3. Tag the exact release-branch commit after the metadata lands.
git fetch origin $RELEASE_BRANCH --tags
git pull --ff-only
RELEASE_TAG=v1.0.0-alpha.7 pnpm release:check
git tag -s v1.0.0-alpha.7 -m "v1.0.0-alpha.7"
git push origin v1.0.0-alpha.7
```

The `Release Desktop (macOS universal + arm64 + Windows + Linux DEB)` workflow contains
seven job definitions (the Linux package job fans out across two architectures):

1. `Test and prepare signing input`, with `contents: read`, explicit
   `id-token: none`, no Apple secrets, and checkout credentials disabled. It
   installs dependencies, runs release metadata checks, typecheck, tests, and
   `apps/desktop/scripts/release.mjs --prepare-only`.
2. `Sign, notarize, package macOS`, gated by the protected `apple-signing`
   environment, with `contents: read` and explicit `id-token: none`. It does
   not check out the repository or run dependency installation/postinstall
   scripts. It downloads the prepared artifact, verifies its SHA-256 digest,
   expands it, and runs `apps/desktop/scripts/release.mjs --sign-stage-only
   --no-publish`
   with the environment-scoped Apple secrets.
3. `Package Linux`, running on native Ubuntu x64 and arm64 GitHub-hosted
   runners. Each job runs `apps/desktop/scripts/release.mjs --linux
   --no-publish`, verifies the packaged ASAR, writes a stable download alias,
   and uploads DEB, RPM, pacman, and tar.gz files as short-retention
   workflow artifacts. The publication job requires both architectures and
   every format (including its stable alias) before hashing or publishing.
4. `Prepare Windows signing input`, running on Windows without an environment
   or signing credentials. It builds a self-contained, hoisted Windows release
   stage that includes the electron-builder toolchain, archives that stage and
   the small signing scripts without workspace `node_modules` links, records
   the archive SHA-256 as a job output, and uploads the archive. This avoids
   Windows tar recursively following pnpm workspace junctions.
5. `Sign and package Windows installer`, gated by the protected
   `windows-signing` environment. It does not check out source or install
   project dependencies/lifecycle scripts. It verifies and expands the exact
   prepared archive, installs `TrustedSigning`, and runs `release.mjs --win
   --sign-stage-only --no-publish --require-signing`. The post-package ASAR
   verifier resolves from the staged toolchain, not the workspace. The Azure
   service-principal secrets are injected only into this signing-aware packaging
   step. After packaging it runs
   `apps/desktop/scripts/windows-release-artifacts.mjs`, which verifies the
   signed installer against its `SHA256SUMS` entry, copies it to the stable name
   `PwrAgent.Setup.exe`, and records that copy in the Windows `SHA256SUMS`
   manifest. Cutting the alias here and nowhere earlier is what makes it a copy
   of a signed installer rather than of an unsigned intermediate.
6. `Publish release assets`, which waits for successful macOS signing, both
   Linux packages, and the signed Windows installer. Only then does it create
   the GitHub Release — always as a `Pre-release`, whatever the tag suffix —
   upload every platform's assets, and generate Linux `SHA256SUMS`. The step
   then reads the release back and fails the job if GitHub did not record
   `isPrerelease: true`. The Windows package checksum manifest is uploaded as
   `PwrAgent-windows-SHA256SUMS` so GitHub Release assets have unique names.
7. `Publish release notes`, which waits for successful all-platform asset
   publishing, extracts the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section, updates the
   GitHub Release body, and fails the workflow if the body still reads back as
   empty.

The macOS no-secret prepare job runs on GitHub's Apple Silicon `macos-26`
host. Icon Composer's Xcode 26 `AssetCatalogAgent` loads macOS 26 frameworks,
so selecting Xcode 26 on `macos-15` crashes during the icon compile even when
`actool --version` passes. The protected macOS signing job uses the same host
for its electron-builder packaging step.

The macOS no-secret prepare job:

1. Verifies `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` matches a fresh deterministic generation.
2. Builds main/preload/renderer with electron-vite.
3. Runs `pnpm deploy --prod` to materialize a flat `node_modules` tree under
   `apps/desktop/release-stage/`.
4. Seeds the stage with `out/`, `build/`, `electron-builder.yml`, `LICENSE`,
   and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`.
5. Archives the prepared stage plus the already-resolved `electron-builder`
   toolchain into the `desktop-release-signing-input` workflow artifact.

The macOS environment-gated signing job:

1. Verifies the prepared artifact SHA-256 from the build job output.
2. Decodes `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64` from the env to a temp `.p8` file.
3. Imports `CSC_LINK` into a generated temporary keychain, verifies its
   Developer ID identity, and makes that keychain first in the user search
   list. It then clears `CSC_KEYCHAIN`, `CSC_LINK`, and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
   before invoking electron-builder. This avoids electron-builder 26.15.x
   passing the `.p12` password to its temporary keychain's
   `set-key-partition-list` command; signing still uses the preloaded identity
   selected through `CSC_NAME`.
4. Patches the staged electron-builder GitHub `releaseType` from the desktop
   package version. This rewrites the staged config only; the job packages with
   `--publish never` and never creates a GitHub Release. The `Pre-release` flag
   on the published release comes from `Publish release assets`, which always
   passes `--prerelease`.
5. Runs `electron-builder --mac --universal --publish never` from the
   downloaded artifact, without invoking `pnpm install`, `npx`, or dependency
   lifecycle scripts. `electron-builder` signs every
   helper bundle individually, signs the main `.app`, submits to Apple's
   notarization service via `notarytool`, staples the ticket, builds the DMG
   and universal updater ZIP, and generates `latest-mac.yml` without creating
   a GitHub Release.
6. Repeats packaging for the separately prepared arm64 stage, merges updater
   metadata, prepares `PwrAgent.dmg` (universal) and `PwrAgent-arm64.dmg`,
   and transfers both signed targets to the all-platform publishing job.

The all-platform publishing job creates the GitHub Release only after the
signed macOS, Windows, and Linux payloads are all available. It uploads the
signed Windows installer alongside the macOS and Linux assets; a failed or
unapproved Windows signing job therefore cannot leave a partial public release.

The Windows jobs use the same trust boundary with a platform-specific final
step. The no-secret job prepares the stage on Windows, because its native
dependencies cannot be prepared on macOS. The protected job verifies the
archive before expanding it and does no source checkout, package-manager
install, or dependency lifecycle execution. It installs only the
`TrustedSigning` PowerShell module required by electron-builder. Windows NSIS
packaging remains inside this job because electron-builder signs the staged app
executables, generated uninstaller, and final installer during packaging; a
post-build signature on only the outer installer would not provide the same
coverage.

Cycle time target: ≤ 12 minutes.

Do not approve the `apple-signing` or `windows-signing` environment unless the
tag, commit, and metadata are the intended release. Do not create the GitHub
Release manually before the build succeeds. A manually created release appears
before all required platform builds have completed. The workflow creates the
release only after it has received the signed macOS and Windows payloads plus
both Linux packages, then the release-notes job verifies and writes the
matching `CHANGELOG.md` content. The release is not complete at either signing
approval gate: after approval, continue watching the run through `Publish
release notes`, then verify the final GitHub Release body is non-empty. If a
monitor or handoff stops at an approval gate, resume after approval rather than
treating the release as done.
Every CI-published release is born as a GitHub `Pre-release`, including a
suffix-free stable tag such as `v1.0.0`. Promotion to Latest is a separate
operator action taken after the assets, updater metadata, and smoke checks are
validated. GitHub excludes pre-release entries from `/releases/latest`,
`PwrAgent.dmg`, and the default Electron updater feed, so a freshly published
release reaches no Stable operator until that promotion.

If the automated release-notes job fails or GitHub temporarily rejects the
release edit, use this manual fallback after confirming the notes file contains
the approved `CHANGELOG.md` entry:

```bash
RELEASE_TAG=v1.0.0-beta.21
mkdir -p .local/release/"$RELEASE_TAG"
node scripts/extract-release-notes.mjs \
  --tag "$RELEASE_TAG" \
  --out .local/release/"$RELEASE_TAG"/RELEASE_NOTES.md
gh release edit "$RELEASE_TAG" \
  --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent \
  --notes-file .local/release/"$RELEASE_TAG"/RELEASE_NOTES.md
gh release view "$RELEASE_TAG" --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --json body \
  --jq '.body | length'
```

If direct push to the release branch is rejected, use the repo-local release
skill fallback: open a short-lived release PR against the release branch, wait
for checks, squash merge it, then tag the merged release-branch commit.

Stable landing-page URL:

```text
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent.dmg
```

Stable Windows download URLs:

```text
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent.Setup.exe
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-windows-SHA256SUMS
```

`PwrAgent.Setup.exe` is spelled the way a Windows installer usually is —
product name, one plain English word, no version and no architecture — and the
periods are not a style choice. GitHub Releases rewrites every space in an
uploaded asset's filename to a period, and renaming the asset afterwards does
not put the space back, so the build names the file what GitHub would store
anyway. Do not "fix" it to `PwrAgent Setup.exe`: the local artifact would then
disagree with the published asset, which is only visible in the release.

Stable Linux download URLs:

```text
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-linux-x64.deb
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-linux-arm64.deb
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-linux-x64.rpm
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-linux-x64.pacman
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/PwrAgent-linux-x64.tar.gz
https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS
```

The RPM, pacman, and tar.gz aliases also have arm64 variants.
These are direct GitHub downloads; this workflow does not publish an RPM/Arch
repository, an AUR entry, or a Flathub listing.

The `Linux Packaging` PR workflow rehearses both native architectures without
publishing. It installs RPMs in Fedora containers and the x64 pacman package in
an Arch container, checking package dependencies and Electron's shared libraries.
These checks do not replace a desktop launch on GNOME Wayland or Omarchy/Hyprland.

AppImage is not currently built. The [third-party license policy](../AGENTS.md#changing-the-allowlist)
records approval for electron-builder's AppImage toolset `1.0.3`, whose pinned
[runtime `20251108`](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/blob/20251108/LICENSE)
statically includes libfuse. Shipping it requires the specified license notices
and complete source/build materials on the same GitHub release. The exception
covers only the runtime stub; any shared libraries electron-builder copies into
the Electron payload require a separate license review. The tar.gz artifact
remains the portable download in this workflow.

Flatpak/Flathub needs a separate design for coding-agent and terminal processes,
project access, profile state, and secrets. In particular,
[`flatpak-spawn --host`](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html)
runs children outside Flatpak's folder restrictions; enabling it would not provide
the folder sandbox operators expect from Flatseal.

Each stable name is a byte-identical copy of the versioned asset from the same
release, so `pwragent.ai` can link these URLs directly instead of resolving the
versioned asset name through the GitHub Releases API. GitHub serves
`/releases/latest/download/` only from a release promoted to Latest, so these
URLs keep serving the previous release until the promotion step below runs.

For the current arm64-only beta, backfill the stable alias:

```bash
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$tmpdir"
gh release download v1.0.0-beta.4 --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --pattern "*arm64.dmg"
mv PwrAgent-*-arm64.dmg PwrAgent.dmg
gh release upload v1.0.0-beta.4 PwrAgent.dmg --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --clobber
```

## Release-matched JavaScript debug artifacts

Every new desktop release retains five separate debug archives, one for each
packaged build: `darwin-universal`, `darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`, `linux-x64`,
and `linux-arm64`. GitHub Release asset names are
`PwrAgent-<version>-<platform>-<arch>-debug.tar.gz`, each with a `.sha256`
sidecar. Release CI also retains the intermediate archives for 30 days;
preview CI retains its universal macOS archive for 14 days alongside the DMG.

`release.mjs` captures each archive immediately after its production Vite
build, before deployment or signing. Both macOS stages have their own archive,
even if their JavaScript happens to match. `--sign-stage-only` consumes the
prepared output without rebuilding or generating maps. Debug archives stay
under `apps/desktop/.local/debug-artifacts/`, outside the deployed stage and
installed app. Vite emits hidden maps for main, preload, and renderer; no
source map URL is added to the JavaScript. The existing builder exclusion and
ASAR verification continue to reject `.map` files in the app. Signing,
notarization, fuses, updater metadata, and installed runtime behavior use the
same packaging path.

Each archive contains:

- `out/`: the exact generated JavaScript and adjacent maps, preserving ASAR
  paths, including workers and lazy chunks; generated HTML and CSS are also
  retained. Maps embed the original source text in `sourcesContent`.
- `manifest.json`: desktop version, release tag, Git commit, tracked tree
  changes, timestamp, target platform/architecture, build host, Node and tool
  versions, lockfile hash, CI repository/ref/run/attempt, and SHA-256/size for
  every retained file. JavaScript entries identify their adjacent map (or
  `null` for copied vendor assets without a Vite map).
- `README.md`: matching and stack-frame lookup instructions.

The publication job requires all five archives and their checksums, verifies
the tag/version/commit/target and clean tracked tree in each manifest, and
checks the uploaded asset names. Missing or mismatched debug artifacts fail
publication. Debug archives contain source text and are public release assets.

To investigate a production stack, download the matching version and target
archive, verify its checksum, then compare the frame's JavaScript SHA-256 from
the installed `app.asar` with `manifest.json`. Use that file's adjacent map;
DevTools can load it manually. Stack lines are 1-based. Source map consumers
take 0-based columns, so subtract one from a browser stack's column. The
embedded sources allow inspection without a checkout. External npm modules
and native code are outside these Vite maps.

Do not rebuild an old tag and assume its offsets match an installed app.
Dependency resolution, platform, and repeated build attempts can change
output; the generated file hash is the deciding match. This retention starts
with releases built by the updated workflow and does not add maps to previous
releases. A separately rebuilt map is usable only after the generated
JavaScript's byte count and SHA-256 match the installed file exactly; a matching
tag, version, or chunk name alone is insufficient.

For a local build without packaging, run `pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop build`
then `node apps/desktop/scripts/desktop-debug-artifacts.mjs darwin universal`
(or another supported platform and architecture). Local archives record the
current tracked tree state; release publication requires a clean tree and
`RELEASE_TAG=v<version>`.

## Updater channel files

`configureAutoUpdaterFeedForRelease` points electron-updater at a `generic`
feed rooted at one release's download directory
(`.../releases/download/<tag>/`). electron-updater then fetches exactly one
file name from that directory, chosen by platform:

| Platform | Channel file |
|---|---|
| macOS | `latest-mac.yml` |
| Windows | `latest.yml` |
| Linux x64 | `latest-linux.yml` |
| Linux arm64 | `latest-linux-arm64.yml` |

If the release does not carry the file for a platform, that platform's update
check fetches a 404 and fails. Every release up to and including
`v1.1.0-alpha.2` published only `latest-mac.yml`, so Windows update checks
failed on every release.

electron-builder writes these files as a side effect of **packaging**, not of
publishing, so the `--publish=never` packaging jobs produce them. The bug was
that the Windows and Linux workflow artifacts never collected them.

The name is `latest*` even for a prerelease version such as `1.1.0-alpha.2`.
electron-builder derives a channel from the version's prerelease tag (writing
`alpha.yml` instead) only for the `generic` publish provider;
`electron-builder.yml` publishes through `github`, which expresses prerelease
status with the release's `Pre-release` flag instead. Do not set
`publish.channel` — that would rename the published files away from the names
the installed builds ask for.

[`apps/desktop/scripts/update-channel-files.mjs`](../apps/desktop/scripts/update-channel-files.mjs)
holds the names. `release.mjs` imports them for its packaging checks and the
release workflow runs the same file as a CLI for its publication checks, so the
two cannot drift. Neither signing job checks out the repository — each gets an
explicit allowlist of scripts in `scripts/release/signing-input-paths.json`.
Both archive producers validate local module imports against that manifest,
materialize its files before archiving so hard links cannot point outside the
archive, then load the extracted electron-builder and ASAR toolchain before a
protected signing environment can be requested. Add any new helper to each
platform that needs it.

Three checks guard this, so a dropped asset fails the release instead of
shipping a broken updater:

- `release.mjs` fails each platform's packaging step if the channel file is
  absent from `dist/`.
- `Verify updater channel files` (`verify-staged`) fails the publication job if
  any of the four is missing from the downloaded artifacts, declares a version
  other than the tag's, or names an installer that is not staged beside it.
- The publication step re-reads the created release (`verify-published`) and
  fails if any of the four did not upload.

## Promoting a release to Latest

CI publishes every release as a GitHub `Pre-release`, so a freshly published
build reaches nobody on Stable · Latest and serves nothing from
`/releases/latest/download/`. Promotion is a deliberate operator action taken
after the release is validated.

Promote only once all of these hold:

- Every platform asset the tag should carry is attached to the release.
- The updater metadata (`latest-mac.yml`, `latest.yml`, `latest-linux*.yml`)
  is attached and names the published version.
- The release body carries the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
- The build has been smoke-checked on at least one machine.

```bash
gh release edit v<version> --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --latest --prerelease=false
```

No retag is needed. Clearing the flag on a suffix-free tag moves it from
Stable · Prerelease into Stable · Latest.

Promotion also begins the [Homebrew and Winget channel procedure](package-manager-distribution.md).
Monitor `package-manager-distribution.yml` through checksum/architecture,
signature, install/upgrade validation and package submissions. Dispatch it
with `submit=true` if the promotion event did not start a run. Review and merge
the tap PR, monitor Microsoft's manifest validation/review, then verify both
authoritative files and refreshed package-manager clients. Include versions,
submission links, last check times and next actions in the release handoff.
Pending review, credentials, CLA or cache/index propagation remains an explicit
channel blocker; do not report publication merely because a PR is open.

**Promote suffix-free tags only.** `--latest` also repoints
`/releases/latest/download/`, so promoting a suffixed tag such as
`v1.1.0-beta.3` would hand the website a beta build while leaving the app's
Stable · Latest slot on the previous stable — `selectChannelReleases` requires
a candidate to be both suffix-free and non-prerelease. Leave suffixed tags as
pre-releases.

To undo a premature promotion, restore the flag:

```bash
gh release edit v<version> --repo pwrdrvr/PwrAgent --prerelease
```

---

## Cutting a release (local path — fallback)

Useful when CI is down or for the very first signed/notarized verification
(plan Phase E5).

```bash
# 1. Source release-time env (do NOT commit this file):
cat > .envrc.release <<'EOF'
export CSC_NAME="Developer ID Application: PwrDrvr LLC (T44CNHC4UH)"
export APPLE_API_KEY=$HOME/Secrets/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
export APPLE_API_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export APPLE_API_ISSUER=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
export APPLE_TEAM_ID=T44CNHC4UH
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxx_fine_grained_PAT_with_Contents_Read_Write_on_pwrdrvr_PwrAgent
EOF
source .envrc.release

# 2. Run the orchestrator. Common local modes:
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop package:dryrun  # unsigned, no publish
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop package         # signed + notarized, no publish
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop release         # signed + notarized + publish
pnpm --filter @pwragent/desktop package:linux   # current-arch Linux packages, no publish
```

The macOS modes need a macOS 26 host with Xcode 26 or newer selected
(`xcode-select -p`, or export `DEVELOPER_DIR`): electron-builder compiles
`build/icon.icon` with `actool`, which requires the matching host runtime and
refuses older tool versions. CI selects one with
`.github/actions/select-xcode-for-actool`; see AGENTS.md "macOS app icon".

The release orchestrator runs `pnpm licenses:check` before packaging. If
dependencies changed, run `pnpm licenses:generate`, review the
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` diff, and commit it before cutting the release.

Verify the produced `.app`:

```bash
APP=apps/desktop/release-stage/dist/mac-universal/PwrAgent.app

# Identity must be PwrDrvr LLC
codesign -dv --verbose=4 "$APP"

# Main executable and native addon must contain both Apple Silicon and Intel slices
lipo -archs "$APP/Contents/MacOS/PwrAgent"
lipo -archs "$APP/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node"

# Gatekeeper-approved (Notarized Developer ID)
spctl -a -vv "$APP"

# Stapled — proves first-launch works offline
stapler validate "$APP"

# All four helpers must NOT contain the string "Electron"
ls "$APP/Contents/Frameworks/" | grep -i electron && echo "FAIL: leaked Electron Helper" || echo "OK"

# Fuses (ASAR integrity must be enabled)
npx --yes @electron/fuses read --app "$APP"

# First-party notices, third-party notices, and release notes must ship in Resources
test -f "$APP/Contents/Resources/LICENSE"
test -f "$APP/Contents/Resources/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES"
test -f "$APP/Contents/Resources/CHANGELOG.md"
```

For releases that include automation scheduling changes, smoke-test one migrated
profile before publishing broadly:

```bash
PWRAGENT_PROFILE=release-smoke open "$APP"
```

Create an interval automation on an existing thread, use **Run now**, confirm it
appears in the thread context and global Automations view, then quit and relaunch
to verify closed-app ticks are not backfilled. Automation state lives in the
profile SQLite database under `~/.pwragent/profiles/<name>/state/state.db`.

## Auto-update on Phase 1

The macOS v1.x binary reads release metadata from GitHub Releases. If a local
run needs an explicit token, the app reads `process.env.GH_TOKEN` at runtime.
The cleanest one-liner is to launch via Terminal:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=ghp_fine_grained_PAT open /Applications/PwrAgent.app
```

Or persist it in `~/.zshrc` (or equivalent) so opening from Spotlight / dock
Just Works. A LaunchAgent plist is also possible but is overkill at Phase 1.

The "Check for Update" button in **Settings → Updates** invokes
`autoUpdater.checkForUpdates()` — useful for verifying the feed is reachable
without waiting for the auto-check on next launch.

### Switching back to a channel that is behind the running build

An operator can end up running a build that is newer than the channel they
have selected — the usual route is a prerelease auto-update landing a `main`
alpha on a machine whose selection later resolves to the Stable train. That
build serves no forward update on the selected channel, so the app treats the
older selected release as a **switch back** rather than "no update":

- The check sets `autoUpdater.allowDowngrade = true` for that check only,
  points the feed at the selected release, and downloads it. Every check that
  resolves to a newer release sets `allowDowngrade` back to `false`.
- The offer is made only for an operator-initiated check — the Settings
  "Check for Update" button, the app menu **Check for Updates**, or the app
  management tool. Startup and hourly background checks still report
  "You're up to date" so an operator who deliberately installed a newer build
  is not asked to move back down on every poll. Tell an operator who is
  stranded to press "Check for Update" after selecting their channel.
- A downloaded switch back never installs on quit. `autoInstallOnAppQuit`
  stays `false` for it, so it applies only when the operator presses
  **Restart to Switch**.
- Surfaces say "Switch to v1.0.2" and "Restart to Switch" instead of the
  update wording, because the operator is moving onto the channel they picked.
- A selected release equal to the running version is still "no update".

Phase 2 distribution channel migration removes the token requirement entirely.
See [desktop-distribution-phase-2-runbook.md](desktop-distribution-phase-2-runbook.md).

Linux builds intentionally skip `electron-updater`. Operators upgrade by
installing the newer DEB, RPM, or pacman package, or replacing the
extracted tar.gz from GitHub Releases; the in-app update status
reports that Linux packages are updated manually.

## What to do if notarization fails

Apple's notarytool returns a submission ID even when notarization fails.
Fetch the JSON log:

```bash
xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> \
  --key "$APPLE_API_KEY" \
  --key-id "$APPLE_API_KEY_ID" \
  --issuer "$APPLE_API_ISSUER"
```

Most-common Electron failures:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "The binary is not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate." | Wrong cert in Keychain or `CSC_LINK` wrong | Re-import `.p12` from 1Password; verify `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` |
| "The signature does not include a secure timestamp." | `--timestamp` flag missing on inner sign | electron-builder ≥ 26 handles this automatically; upgrade builder |
| "The executable does not have the hardened runtime enabled." | Missing `mac.hardenedRuntime: true` | Confirm in `electron-builder.yml` |
| "The entitlement com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit ... is missing on a helper bundle." | `entitlementsInherit` not pointing at the same plist | Confirm `mac.entitlements` and `mac.entitlementsInherit` both reference `build/entitlements.mac.plist` |
| Hangs on "Waiting for notarization status..." for >30 min | Apple infrastructure congestion | Wait or re-submit; both submissions count against the same successful staple |

## Cert custody, rotation, and never-do list

- **Never** rotate the Developer ID Application certificate without coordinating
  a re-install ritual. Squirrel.Mac validates that the new binary's Team ID
  matches the running app's. If you ship a binary signed under a different
  Team ID, every existing user must re-install through a Gatekeeper warning.
  Apple permits multiple Developer ID certs simultaneously — use overlap to
  rotate without forcing re-install.
- **Never** revoke a Developer ID cert unless it is confirmed leaked.
  Revocation invalidates every shipped binary signed with it (existing
  installs stop launching after their staple expires).
- **Never** commit `.p12`, `.p8`, `.envrc.release`, or any `AuthKey_*.p8` to
  the repo. The `.gitignore` blocks these by default.
