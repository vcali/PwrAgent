# Desktop renderer recovery

The desktop UI can fail while the Electron main process continues running
agents, queues, messaging, and federation. Recovery must preserve that ownership:
it never restarts the app, closes the shell, or resubmits a turn.

## Evidence and primary sources

The operator's 2026-10-02 v1.1.5 incident was a React root-boundary failure.
Main, federation, and agent turns remained alive. Clearing the boundary's report
restored the UI for the observed 15 seconds. Release-matched source maps located
the throw at `ComposerErrorRail.tsx:32:5`; the initiating production loop remains
unreproduced. The connection to the separately reproduced navigation admission
failure is unproven. PR [#2503](https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrAgent/pull/2503),
squash-merged at `dd6eae534`, retains bounded multiline stacks, removes
effect-driven composer dismissal cleanup, and coalesces navigation reads.

Primary-source research, accessed 2026-10-03:

| Source | Verified pattern and relevance |
| --- | --- |
| [React error #185](https://react.dev/errors/185) | Identifies maximum update depth, consistent with the reported boundary failure. It does not establish the initiating loop here. |
| [React Component: error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) | `getDerivedStateFromError` displays a fallback; `componentDidCatch` supplies an error and component stack for diagnostics. A boundary does not catch event-handler, ordinary asynchronous, or its own errors. |
| [React state preservation](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) | Removing a component destroys its local state. State that must survive must live outside the removed subtree. |
| [Electron crash reporting](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/crash-reporting#reacting-to-crashes-at-runtime) | Native termination is distinct from a JavaScript exception. The guide demonstrates `render-process-gone`, reason/exit-code logging, and bounded reload retries. Its retry policy is an example, not a guarantee for PwrAgent. |
| [Electron webContents](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-render-process-gone) | Reports renderer disappearance separately from `unresponsive`. `forcefullyCrashRenderer` can terminate a shared renderer process, so crash probes need an isolated fixture. |
| [Slack: Building Hybrid Applications with Electron](https://slack.engineering/building-hybrid-applications-with-electron/) | This historical engineering account describes restarting an individual team renderer without affecting the rest of the app. It does not specify current retry limits, React remounts, or draft retention. |

The user's observations that Slack and Spotify sometimes reload themselves are
user-provided context. No primary source found in this research establishes
Spotify's automatic recovery mechanism or retry policy. Spotify's
[own open-source page](https://www.spotify.com/ps-en/opensource/) identifies CEF
in its desktop client; that is not evidence of Electron or a reload policy.

## Recovery policy

| Failure | Automatic action | Limit and fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root React error boundary | Report the JavaScript and React stacks plus attempt/action metadata, show the fallback, then clear the report after one second. The fallback already unmounted the failed subtree, so clearing it mounts a fresh UI in the same document. | Two automatic remounts for the boundary lifetime. Further failures remain on a usable fallback with **Try again**. Manual retries do not replenish the budget. |
| Main/federation shell renderer termination | Main logs webContents ID, reason, exit code, and recovery attempt, then reloads the same webContents after one second. | Two automatic reloads for the BrowserWindow lifetime, including across successful loads. Further failures or a failed replacement load offer a native **Reload window / Leave window** dialog. Manual reloads do not replenish the budget. Clean exits and destroyed windows do not retry; closing cancels queued retries. |
| Unresponsive renderer, global error, or unhandled rejection | Existing reporting remains in place; no automatic recovery is inferred. | An unresponsive page might resume, and an asynchronous error does not necessarily invalidate the UI. Those need separate evidence and ownership decisions. |

Budgets deliberately have no healthy-period reset. A recurring persistent fault
cannot establish an endless periodic retry cycle. The counters and checkpoints
are window-local memory; this feature adds no SQLite writes or idle timers.
Main's existing `render-process-gone` handler still stops its window diagnostics.
Renderer termination no longer invokes the main-window shutdown path; only an
actual window close participates in the existing quit-confirmation flow.
This feature does not add minidump collection or uploads.

The same React boundary protects auxiliary routes. Automatic native termination
recovery is installed on main/federation shell windows; auxiliary BrowserWindows
retain their existing native lifecycle. **View → Reload Window** is always
available, including after dismissing the native recovery dialog. Developer
Tools and force reload remain developer-mode controls. Recovery does not restore
a main-process crash.

## State preservation and limitations

`RendererRecoveryStateProvider` lives above the boundary. It owns the existing
window-local composer store and its durable wrapper, retaining their identity,
active draft text, editor document, skill tokens, image/file references, parked
drafts, pending steers, and queued-turn projections. Composer cleanup saves its
latest snapshot into that surviving store. Hydration and the existing five-second
save interval continue during the fallback; recovery does not dispatch drafts.
The provider hydrates only routes with composers.

Only committed navigation state is checkpointed: selection, active browsing
lens, shell view, local launchpad metadata, the active federated launchpad, and
Back/Forward stacks. Committed ref containers also retain actual startup-selection
readiness, manual-focus markers, and submitted seen-update versions. Recovery
before the initial read still establishes startup selection when rows arrive;
a settled empty selection stays empty. Focus keeps clearing subsequent unread
updates outside Attention, without repeating already submitted seen writes when
the recovered read returns stale rows. The restored UI refreshes main-owned
projections and subscriptions. Failed renders are not checkpointed. Each window
has its own provider; drafts never become federated or cross-window shared state.

An in-flight local launchpad's temporary `starting-launchpad:*` selection cannot
resolve after its pending UI row is unmounted. Recovery clears that temporary
key and displays the normal **Select a thread** view. The main-owned creation
continues once, and recovery does not automatically follow its eventual result.
The operator can select the resulting thread after navigation refreshes. This
does not cancel or resubmit the launch.

A native renderer death or full page reload destroys these in-memory checkpoints.
Saved composer drafts remain available through the existing durable recovery
store, but the last unsaved interval (normally up to five seconds, or longer if
a save failed) can be lost. Window bounds, native identity, and federation target
survive because main reloads the existing shell. Selection/history reset on
native reload; saved drafts can be opened again by selecting their thread.

React remounts also reset ephemeral component state: editor caret/undo history,
transcript scroll position, open menus/dialogs, unsaved Settings forms, and
auxiliary view state that has no existing persistence. An in-flight launch or
attachment conversion must still obey its existing ownership rules; recovery is
not a transactional snapshot of every UI operation. The underlying production
loop is not reproduced or claimed fixed by recovery.

## Regression coverage

- Boundary tests cover transient success, persistent and recurring faults,
  diagnostic stacks/attempt metadata, manual retry without budget reset, and
  cancellation on unmount.
- Provider tests cover Strict Mode remounts, exact rich draft snapshots, parked
  drafts, main-owned queue identities, committed selection, and window isolation.
- Navigation remount tests cover the active lens, recovery before startup reads
  settle, settled empty selection, manual-focus unread clearing and Attention's
  exemption, seen-write deduplication, and an in-flight launchpad finishing once
  after its temporary selection is cleared.
- Main tests cover termination evidence before reload, lifetime limits, native
  fallback, close/clean-exit handling, and an actual `ThreadTurnQueue` completing
  its running entry and admitting its queued successor after recovery.
  Bootstrap tests verify that termination retains agent, messaging, and
  federation resources and cannot approve an unanswered quit confirmation.
- `renderer-recovery.spec.ts` uses contrived replay data to test an actual root
  boundary remount with an unsent composer draft while main consumes a turn's
  completion, persistent boundary fallback/manual recovery, and real Electron
  renderer termination with durable draft restoration and unchanged main/window
  identity. It does not exercise live federation peers or reproduce the original
  maximum-depth loop.
