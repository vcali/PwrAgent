# PwrAgent UI Theme

This document is the durable source of truth for PwrAgent's visual theme. It pairs with [docs/design/desktop-style-guide.md](design/desktop-style-guide.md): the style guide covers desktop product layout and component behavior, while this document covers the theme thesis, palette, token usage, and visual anti-patterns.

## Theme Thesis

PwrAgent uses a **Tangerine Terminal** theme:

- absolute black app canvas
- near-black structural surfaces
- warm white primary text
- neutral gray secondary text
- sparse tangerine signal
- dense, editorial, operator-tool composition
- restrained motion and minimal elevation

The desired impression is a serious black-first workstation that feels cool enough to work in all day. It should pop through contrast, typography, and precise orange signal, not through decoration.

Avoid gray text on darker gray, generic blue-black Electron dashboard styling, and orange novelty-terminal cosplay.

## Token Contract

The desktop renderer centralizes theme values in [apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/app.css](../apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/app.css). Keep new UI on these semantic tokens instead of adding one-off colors.

```css
--bg-app: #000000;
--bg-sidebar: #050505;
--bg-panel: #0a0a0a;
--bg-panel-elevated: #101010;
--bg-panel-hover: #14110d;
--bg-row-active: #120800;
--bg-input: #080808;

--border-subtle: rgba(247, 243, 235, 0.1);
--border-strong: rgba(247, 243, 235, 0.2);

--text-primary: #f7f3eb;
--text-secondary: #b8b0a5;
--text-muted: #8c857a;

--terminal-bg: #000000;
--terminal-fg: #cccccc;
--terminal-cursor: #ffb35c;
--terminal-cursor-accent: #160a00;
--terminal-ansi-black: #000000;
--terminal-ansi-red: #cd3131;
--terminal-ansi-green: #0dbc79;
--terminal-ansi-yellow: #e5e510;
--terminal-ansi-blue: #2472c8;
--terminal-ansi-magenta: #bc3fbc;
--terminal-ansi-cyan: #11a8cd;
--terminal-ansi-white: #e5e5e5;
--terminal-ansi-bright-black: #666666;
--terminal-ansi-bright-red: #f14c4c;
--terminal-ansi-bright-green: #23d18b;
--terminal-ansi-bright-yellow: #f5f543;
--terminal-ansi-bright-blue: #3b8eea;
--terminal-ansi-bright-magenta: #d670d6;
--terminal-ansi-bright-cyan: #29b8db;
--terminal-ansi-bright-white: #e5e5e5;
--terminal-scrollbar-thumb: color-mix(in srgb, var(--terminal-fg) 34%, transparent);

--accent: #ff8a1f;
--accent-strong: #ffa33d;
--accent-bright: #ffb35c;
--accent-soft: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 12%, transparent);
--accent-border: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 42%, transparent);
--accent-shadow: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 34%, transparent);
--focus-ring: var(--accent);
```

Status colors may exist, but they should remain low-volume and functional:

- danger: red-orange text or soft fill for destructive and failed states
- success: muted green for completed or healthy states
- info: desaturated blue for non-primary informational state

Status colors should not compete with tangerine as the main action and focus signal.

### Theme Variants

The renderer ships two themes (dark + light) plus a system mode that
follows `prefers-color-scheme`. Each scheme renders in the color theme the
operator picked for it (see [Color themes](#color-themes)). The token
tables below are the Tangerine pair, the default for both schemes. Theme selection lives in per-profile
`config.toml` under `[general.appearance]` and is applied via a
`data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. The dark palette is the unscoped
`:root` block; the light palette is opt-in under
`:root[data-theme="light"]`.

The contract: every token below is part of the **public theme
surface** — a future custom theme (high-contrast, OLED, brand
re-skin) is allowed to override any of these and only these. New
tokens added to `:root` are not part of the contract until they're
listed here. Tokens declared via `color-mix(in srgb, var(--token) X%,
transparent)` derive their final value from their base; overriding
the base is enough to flip every derived alpha.

#### Surfaces

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg-app` | `#000000` | `#ffffff` |
| `--bg-sidebar` | `#050505` | `#f7f4ef` |
| `--bg-panel` | `#0a0a0a` | `#fdfcfa` |
| `--bg-panel-elevated` | `#101010` | `#ffffff` |
| `--bg-panel-hover` | `#14110d` | `#f4f0e8` |
| `--bg-row-active` | `#120800` | `#fff5e9` |
| `--bg-input` | `#080808` | `#ffffff` |

#### Borders

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--border-subtle` | `rgba(247, 243, 235, 0.1)` | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)` |
| `--border-strong` | `rgba(247, 243, 235, 0.2)` | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18)` |

#### Text

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-primary` | `#f7f3eb` | `#1a1612` |
| `--text-secondary` | `#b8b0a5` | `#524a40` |
| `--text-muted` | `#8c857a` | `#736c64` |
| `--text-subtle` | `rgba(247, 243, 235, 0.42)` | `rgba(26, 22, 18, 0.42)` |

#### Integrated Terminal

The integrated terminal has its own canvas and ANSI tokens. The ANSI values
mirror VS Code's light/dark defaults so common shell output remains readable
when the app theme changes.

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--terminal-bg` | `#000000` | `#ffffff` |
| `--terminal-fg` | `#cccccc` | `#333333` |
| `--terminal-cursor` | `#ffb35c` | `#d96d00` |
| `--terminal-cursor-accent` | `#160a00` | `#ffffff` |
| `--terminal-ansi-black` | `#000000` | `#000000` |
| `--terminal-ansi-red` | `#cd3131` | `#cd3131` |
| `--terminal-ansi-green` | `#0dbc79` | `#107c10` |
| `--terminal-ansi-yellow` | `#e5e510` | `#949800` |
| `--terminal-ansi-blue` | `#2472c8` | `#0451a5` |
| `--terminal-ansi-magenta` | `#bc3fbc` | `#bc05bc` |
| `--terminal-ansi-cyan` | `#11a8cd` | `#0598bc` |
| `--terminal-ansi-white` | `#e5e5e5` | `#555555` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-black` | `#666666` | `#666666` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-red` | `#f14c4c` | `#cd3131` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-green` | `#23d18b` | `#14ce14` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-yellow` | `#f5f543` | `#b5ba00` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-blue` | `#3b8eea` | `#0451a5` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-magenta` | `#d670d6` | `#bc05bc` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-cyan` | `#29b8db` | `#0598bc` |
| `--terminal-ansi-bright-white` | `#e5e5e5` | `#a5a5a5` |
| `--terminal-scrollbar-thumb` | derived (34% of `--terminal-fg`) | derived |

#### Accent (Tangerine Terminal)

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--accent` | `#ff8a1f` | `#b74c00` |
| `--accent-strong` | `#ffa33d` | `#b34a00` |
| `--accent-bright` | `#ffb35c` | `#994c00` |
| `--accent-soft` | derived (12% of `--accent`) | derived |
| `--accent-border` | derived (42% of `--accent`) | derived |
| `--accent-shadow` | derived (34% of `--accent`) | derived |
| `--focus-ring` | `var(--accent)` | `var(--accent)` |
| `--button-text` | `#120800` | `#ffffff` |

The light-theme accent is darker (`#b74c00`) for WCAG-readable contrast on light surfaces. Button text on accent flips white in light theme.

**The ramp travels in opposite directions per theme.** `--accent` → `--accent-strong` → `--accent-bright` means increasing emphasis in both themes, but emphasis reads as *lighter* on a dark surface and *darker* on a light one:

| | `--accent` | `--accent-strong` | `--accent-bright` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dark (emphasis = lightness) | `#ff8a1f` | `#ffa33d` | `#ffb35c` |
| Light (emphasis = depth) | `#b74c00` | `#b34a00` | `#994c00` |

Hue and saturation are held constant per token across the flip — only lightness moves — so both themes render the same tangerine. The brand mark reads `--accent` in every window (see the chrome table in `AGENTS.md`), and its light-theme hue is unchanged by this retune: `#c45200` → `#b74c00` holds Lab hue at 54.2° and moves ΔE2000 3.3.

**Pick contrast against the darkest background a token can land on, not against `--bg-app`.** Measuring against white alone is what let `--accent` ship at 4.61:1 on `--bg-app` but 4.20:1 on the sidebar wordmark, and `--text-muted` at 4.34:1 on white but 3.82:1 on a hovered row.

"Darkest background" is **not** always a flat `--bg-*` token. 34 rules pair `background: var(--accent-soft)` (12% accent) with `color: var(--accent-bright)`, and that composite is darker than `--bg-panel-hover` — so `--accent-bright` is floored against the tint (4.64:1) rather than the flat surface (5.45:1). Retuned tokens and their worst case:

| Token | Worst-case | Measured against |
|---|---|---|
| `--accent` | 4.57:1 | `--bg-panel-hover` |
| `--accent-strong` | 4.74:1 | `--bg-panel-hover` |
| `--accent-bright` | 4.64:1 | `--accent-soft` over `--bg-panel-hover` |
| `--text-muted` | 4.55:1 | `--bg-panel-hover` |

### Known light-theme contrast debt (not fixed)

The light block is **not** uniformly AA-clean. These predate the accent retune and remain open:

| Token / pair | Worst-case | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `--accent` on `--accent-soft` | 3.88–4.39 | 7 (6 onboarding wizard + `.launchpad-pending__status`) — should move to `--accent-bright` |
| `--status-warning` `#a86b00` | 3.87:1 | 16 `color:` rules — move text to `--status-warning-text` |
| `--info-teal` `#0e9b95` | 3.01:1 | 1 |
| `--text-subtle` `rgba(26,22,18,.42)` | 2.38:1 | 3 |
| `--status-ok` `#2e7d3c` | 4.49:1 | 2 (marginal) |

`apps/desktop/e2e/a11y.spec.ts` gates both themes, but only across the surfaces it drives — the onboarding wizard is not one of them. **A green gate is not a claim about the whole app.**

#### Semantic — danger / success / info

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--danger-base` | `#b94232` | `#8a1f12` |
| `--danger-soft` | `rgba(185, 66, 50, 0.24)` | `rgba(138, 31, 18, 0.12)` |
| `--danger-border` | derived | `rgba(138, 31, 18, 0.28)` |
| `--danger-text` | `#ffb0a1` | `#8a1f12` |
| `--success-soft` | `rgba(74, 148, 92, 0.18)` | `rgba(46, 110, 64, 0.14)` |
| `--success-border` | `rgba(74, 148, 92, 0.32)` | `rgba(46, 110, 64, 0.28)` |
| `--success-text` | `#9ce5b3` | `#1a5c2e` |
| `--info-soft` | `rgba(86, 137, 196, 0.16)` | `rgba(54, 102, 165, 0.12)` |
| `--info-border` | `rgba(86, 137, 196, 0.28)` | `rgba(54, 102, 165, 0.24)` |
| `--info-text` | `#9fc8ff` | `#1a4f8a` |

#### Status indicators

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--status-ok` | `#5fa969` | `#2e7d3c` |
| `--status-warning` | `#d99a3d` | `#a86b00` |
| `--status-warning-text` | `var(--status-warning)` | `#945c00` |
| `--status-suspended` | `#6b6660` | `#6b6660` |
| `--status-error` | `#c45a3a` | `#a8472a` |

`--status-warning` is for dots, strokes, and meters. Use `--status-warning-text`
when the warning is something read: a figure, a sentence, or a chip label. Its
light value is the `--savings-over` amber, at least 4.5:1 on every light
surface. The usage pace sentence and the Pricing rail's pace card use it.

#### Token Miser verdict

Token Miser colors its savings by degrees. `classifyTokenMiserSavings` in
`@pwragent/shared` places the printed percentage (savings over the estimated
unfiltered cost, rounded to 0.1) on this scale:

| Tier | Range | Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exceptional` | ≥ 30% | `--savings-great` | `var(--success-text)` | `var(--success-text)` |
| `great` | 10% to < 30% | `--savings-great` | `var(--success-text)` | `var(--success-text)` |
| `good` | 5% to < 10% | `--savings-good` | `var(--status-ok)` | `var(--status-ok)` |
| `even` | between −5% and 5% | `--savings-even` | `var(--text-secondary)` | `var(--text-secondary)` |
| `over` | ≤ −5% | `--savings-over` | `var(--status-warning)` | `#945c00` |

- Only `--savings-over` has a light override. `--status-warning` measures
  4.0:1 on a light panel. The theme contract measures all four inks in both
  themes.
- `--savings-great-soft` and `--savings-great-border` alias the `--success-*`
  pair. They draw the pill that great and exceptional put around the
  percentage, and the exceptional card's border.
- Surfaces do not read the tier tokens directly. The element that holds the
  figure gets `data-savings-tier`, which sets the local `--savings-verdict`.
  Each colored part reads `var(--savings-verdict, <neutral>)`.
- A verdict is never the accent. The accent says "look here", and it used to
  say that for a saving and an overhead alike.

#### One-off accents

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--info-teal` | `#2dd6d0` | `#0e9b95` |
| `--brand-purple` | `#8a6dc4` | `#6a4ba8` |
| `--danger-text-light` | `#ffba8a` | `#b03517` |

#### Tokens that do NOT theme-flip

These are intentionally theme-neutral and should not be overridden by a
custom theme:

- `--shadow-base` (`#000000`) — drop shadows stay dark in both themes
  (standard drop-shadow pattern); `--shadow-tint-*` and `--scrim-*`
  derive from it.
- `--shadow-popover` — light theme reduces alpha (0.42 → 0.18) because
  heavy shadows over white read poorly; not a base color.
- `--star-map-float-border` / `--star-map-float-shadow` — the edge and
  lift of the Star Map's floating chat cards and satellites. The dark
  stack adds a light halo so a card separates from the black sky and from
  a card beneath it; light theme drops the halo and softens the ring.
- `--chat-column-max` (`940px`) — layout token, not a color.

#### Derived tokens

The full list of `color-mix(...)` derivatives in `:root` (e.g.
`--surface-overlay-*`, `--accent-underline`, `--scrollbar-thumb`,
`--row-active-tint-*`, `--shadow-tint-*`) follow whichever base they
reference. A custom theme overriding `--accent` automatically updates
every accent-derived alpha overlay. See
[`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/app.css`](../apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/app.css)
for the live list.

Raw color literals outside `:root` / `:root[data-theme="..."]` are
blocked by `pnpm lint:colors` (in CI). Use `var(--token)` or
`color-mix(in srgb, var(--token) X%, transparent)` for derived
alphas. Illustration assets that intentionally don't theme-flip
(currently only the lunar-phase context-window indicator) are
substring-allowlisted in
[`scripts/lint-renderer-colors.mjs`](../scripts/lint-renderer-colors.mjs).

### Color themes

The operator picks a **dark theme** and a **light theme** independently,
as most editors do. Theme (system, dark, or light) still picks the scheme;
the scheme the window resolves to chooses which of the two renders. So
"system" follows the OS between any dark theme and any light theme.
`[general.appearance] dark_theme` and `light_theme` in `config.toml` hold
the choices. The Tangerine defaults are not written to the file. Settings →
General → Appearance sets them.

| Dark theme | Light theme | Origin |
|---|---|---|
| `tangerine-dark` (default) | `tangerine-light` (default) | PwrAgent. The bare `:root` / `:root[data-theme="light"]` blocks. |
| `catppuccin-mocha` | `catppuccin-latte` | [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) ([MIT](https://catppuccin.com/licensing/)), tuned to the lowest compliant contrast. |
| `solarized-dark` | `solarized-light` | [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) ([MIT](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/blob/master/LICENSE)), canonical surfaces and terminal, text moved only as far as AA needs. |
| `gray-dark` | `gray-light` | PwrAgent. Neutral charcoal or light-gray surfaces with the Tangerine accent. |
| `blue-dark` | `blue-light` | PwrAgent. Navy or pale-blue surfaces with a blue accent. |
| `matrix-dark` | (none) | PwrAgent, after the look of *The Matrix* (1999). Phosphor code green on green-tinted near-black. Dark only. |

Each non-default theme is one `:root[data-color-theme="<id>"]` block in
`app.css`, and `data-color-theme` is set only while that theme renders.
`data-theme` stays the scheme whatever the color theme. Rules and scripts
that key on `data-theme="light"`, such as brand marks and Mermaid, need no
theme knowledge. A light theme's block has the same specificity as
`:root[data-theme="light"]` and comes later in the file, so it wins.

Every block sets the full themeable token set (Catppuccin Mocha's block is
the reference list). A token a block leaves out would fall through to a
stray Tangerine color. Terminal ANSI colors are the one optional group: a
theme without its own keeps Tangerine's. No block sets the theme-neutral
tokens listed above. Those follow the scheme block.

#### Contrast

Every color theme holds the same floor, measured against the
lowest-contrast background each token can land on. Those backgrounds are
the flat surfaces, plus the 12% and 16% accent tints over panel, sidebar,
and hover:

- Every token read as text clears 4.55:1. That is AA plus 0.05 of margin
  for rendering. Semantic text also clears its own soft tint.
- `--accent` is floored against the accent tints too, and `--text-subtle`
  clears AA. The color themes inherit none of the light-theme debt above.
- Non-text marks clear 3.05:1 on the flat surfaces. These are
  `--danger-base`, `--status-suspended`, and the usage chart series.
- Text ladders (primary, secondary, muted) and accent ramps keep their
  emphasis order.

Per theme:

- **Catppuccin** sits at the floor on purpose. Its text ladder is
  7.5 / 5.75 / 4.55. Mocha colors dim toward its base, so the pastels keep
  their hue. Latte colors move in lightness only. Mocha's terminal ANSI
  colors are Catppuccin's own. In Latte, each one under 4.5:1 is darkened
  to it.
- **Solarized** keeps the published surfaces (`base03`/`base02`,
  `base3`/`base2`), terminal canvas, foreground, and 16-color ANSI mapping.
  Its stock text does not clear AA on `base02`: `base0` is 4.1:1 and
  `base01` is 2.4:1. Text, accent, and semantic colors therefore move in
  lightness only, by the least that clears the floor, with a tighter
  ladder (5.75 / 5.05 / 4.55). The dark accent is Solarized yellow, because
  orange cannot clear AA as text on `base03`. With only two background
  tones per scheme, hover sits midway between them, and Light's raised
  surface sits just above `base3`, so neither disappears into the surface
  under it.
- **Gray** and **Blue** are PwrAgent designs, and keep their designed values
  wherever those already clear the floor. Blue is an explicit product
  choice. Its navy surfaces stay low-saturation, so the anti-pattern below
  against saturated navy dashboards still holds.
- **Matrix** is a PwrAgent design after the film's look, and an explicit
  product request. Its accent and terminal ink are the phosphor code green
  `#00ff41`, on green-tinted near-black surfaces. The red and blue pills are
  its danger and info hues. It is a palette, not a costume. There is no code
  rain, glow, or scanline effect, so the anti-patterns below against
  novelty-terminal cosplay and decorative glows still hold. It borrows no
  published palette and so carries no license notice. Only muted text moved
  from its designed value to clear the floor.
- **A theme may be dark only.** Matrix has no light half, so picking it
  offers no pair for the light scheme, and the operator's light theme stays
  as it was.

The theme contract test checks all of this. It reads `app.css` and fails if
a theme drops a token, misses the floor, breaks a ladder, or if
Catppuccin's `--text-muted` or `--accent` drifts to 4.7:1 or above. The
a11y E2E gate audits every theme in its scheme. The native window colors
(`native-appearance.ts`) and the quit dialog palettes
(`quit-confirmation-dialog.ts`) carry literal copies. Tests hold each one
to its `app.css` block.

### Status indicator dots

For small live-state pips (messaging platform health, per-thread binding
activity, future system-state indicators) use the `--status-*` tokens with
the `.status-dot` utility class:

```css
--status-ok: #5fa969;          /* enabled and healthy */
--status-warning: #d99a3d;     /* needs attention but still working */
--status-suspended: #6b6660;   /* configured but intentionally paused */
--status-error: #c45a3a;       /* configured, attempted, currently failing */
```

Activity (sending or receiving in flight) is signalled by adding the
`.status-dot--blink` modifier — a 1.6s `ease-in-out` opacity pulse. The
animation is suppressed under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

These dots are subordinate signals: keep them at 8px or smaller, never use
them as the primary call-to-action color, and never use them in body copy.

## Icons

Renderer iconography lives in
[apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/icons/](../apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/icons/).
Every shipped icon should be an exported component from that directory.

- Stroke icons render at 16px square with `strokeWidth: 1.75` and use
  `currentColor` so callers control color via CSS.
- Decorative icons stay `aria-hidden`. Pass `aria-label` only when the icon
  is the *only* signal of meaning (the component flips to `role="img"`
  automatically).
- **No emoji as iconography.** Emoji are content (e.g., user reactions),
  never UI chrome. Folder, branch, worktree, settings, platform marks, etc.
  must come from the icon library.
- **One object per icon, and judge it at ship size.** Icons render at
  12–16px in chips, picker rows, and meta chips — not at the size you
  draw them. A mark that needs two objects to read (crossed tools, a
  document behind a gear) turns to mush or, worse, resolves into a
  different recognizable glyph. `SkillIcon` is a lone wrench for exactly
  this reason: the crossed wrench + screwdriver it replaced was clear at
  24px and read as scissors at 13px. Render a candidate at its real size
  on the real surface before committing to it.

## Color Rules

Use absolute black as the app foundation. Panels, sidebars, inputs, and message surfaces should be near-black, not gray slabs.

Use warm white for primary labels and content. Use neutral gray for timestamps, helper text, secondary labels, and less important metadata. Do not make the main reading experience gray-on-gray.

Use tangerine for:

- primary action states
- selected and focused controls
- active lens state
- selected thread row cues
- unread cookies
- important command labels and links

Do not use tangerine for:

- body copy
- large background panels
- decorative gradients
- every badge in a row
- generic metadata

The accent should feel like a trading-terminal signal: exact, limited, and useful.

### Accent ramp: one signal per row

The palette has held one tangerine since the theme shipped — `--accent` has never changed value. Drift comes from the *ramp being spent without a rule*, not from stale colors. Each step has exactly one job:

| Token | Job | Never |
|---|---|---|
| `--accent` | Solid fills, and the thread-row selection bar | Text |
| `--accent-border` | Outline of a **selected** container | Idle chrome, badges |
| `--accent-soft` | Fill of a **highlighted** row or surface | Large panels |
| `--accent-bright` | Text on an accent tint, and the typed run in a picker | Body copy, metadata |

**The rule: a row carries its selection treatment plus at most one more accent element.** Badges, kind icons, boxed sigils, and counts rank via neutrals (`--border-strong` + `--text-primary` for emphasis, `--border-subtle` + `--text-secondary` for ordinary metadata). A row showing a bar, an outline, a boxed glyph, a highlighted match, and a pill all in tangerine has no signal left — everything is emphasized, so nothing is.

### The two selection languages are not interchangeable

Both are tangerine; they answer different questions. Picking the wrong one is what made the composer autocompletes look like four unrelated controls.

**Popover highlight — "Enter lands here."** Transient, follows the cursor or arrow keys, gone when the popover closes.

```css
background: var(--accent-soft);
color: var(--accent-bright);
```

Used by `.project-picker__row`, `.branch-picker__option`, `.reference-picker__row`, every `.composer__autocomplete-option`, and the Select's cursor row, `.select-option.is-active`. No bar, no outline.

**Row selection — "this is what you're looking at."** Persistent, survives navigation, coexists with hover.

```css
border-color: var(--accent-border);
background: var(--bg-row-active);
/* plus the 3px ::before bar in var(--accent) */
```

Used by `.thread-row.is-selected` and its derivatives. Do not lend the bar to a popover.

**Consequence for match highlighting:** on a highlighted row the label is already `--accent-bright`, so a color-only "typed run" highlight vanishes on exactly the row being read. Emphasize the match with **weight** (`font-weight: 700`) so it survives both states.

`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/styles/__tests__/theme-contract.test.tsx` locks all of the above for the autocomplete family. Changing it deliberately means changing the test in the same commit.

## Typography

Use a restrained desktop typography system:

- primary sans: `Geist Sans`, `Geist`, `SF Pro Text`, `Inter`, `system-ui`, `sans-serif`
- utility mono: `Geist Mono`, `SF Mono`, `JetBrains Mono`, `Consolas`, `monospace`

The renderer bundles Geist Sans and Geist Mono from `@fontsource/geist-sans` and `@fontsource/geist-mono` (`styles/fonts.css`), the same packages PwrGit and PwrSnap ship. The package registers the sans as `Geist Sans`, not upstream's `Geist`, and a face loads only when a rule names it exactly, so each stack leads with the registered name. `styles/__tests__/bundled-fonts.test.ts` holds that lead. Every monospace rule reads `--font-mono`; do not hard-code a mono stack.

To prove which font drew a node, use CDP `CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode`. `document.fonts.check()` answers true for a family no face in the set matches.

Rules:

- no viewport-scaled font sizes
- no negative letter spacing
- no oversized utility headings
- use mono for branch names, paths, worktree labels, command-ish labels, and machine state
- keep text dense, scannable, and stable as state changes

## Component Theme Rules

### Shell

The shell is a workstation, not a landing page. Use a fixed left operating rail and a primary work surface. Avoid stacked floating cards on a dark background.

The main app canvas should stay black. Structural separation should come from spacing, typography, subtle borders, and selected-state treatment before shadows or filled panels.

### Sidebar

The sidebar is an information surface. It should read like an active operating queue.

The thread lens switch is:

1. `Recents`
2. `Directories`

`Recents` is the default browsing lens and carries a user-curated Pins section at the top of the same scrollable thread list. Unread state is row-local: use the orange cookie marker on any thread row that has updated-since-seen activity instead of a separate Inbox lens.

Do not show a generic Browse header, thread count, or timestamp above the lens switch. Let the rows carry the useful context.

### Thread Rows

Thread rows are one of the main theme carriers. They should be compact, warm, and readable.

Selected rows should use:

- warm active background
- tangerine border or left bar
- stable geometry with no layout shift
- metadata that remains readable without overpowering the title

Unread state uses an orange cookie marker. Do not use a punctuation badge such as `!` for unread.

The secondary "just clicked" or focus highlight must never clip on the left edge, resize the row, or obscure the selected state.

### Lens Switches

Segmented controls should feel crisp and physical. The active segment uses tangerine text or outline. Inactive segments use muted text and near-black surfaces.

State transitions must not ghost the orange outline under another segment. Prefer a direct state update over crossfading borders, backgrounds, or outlines when animation makes the control look wrong.

### Header

Thread detail headers should be compact. Use the thread title as the primary label, then align mode and access pills with it.

Avoid oversized "widget" header areas. Do not show message count or synced-at metadata in the top-right header unless it becomes actionable product context.

### Transcript

Transcript surfaces should stay black-first. Message cards can have subtle near-black backgrounds and tangerine borders when they need focus, but large orange fills should be avoided.

Do not show redundant transcript headers or message-count sublabels above the message list. The panel can keep an accessible label, but the visible surface should start with the transcript content.

Do not put cards inside cards. Do not make the transcript feel like an embedded preview.

### Composer

The reply box is a primary work surface. It can be taller than a standard form input and should feel intentional, with low-contrast chrome until focused.

Controls below the composer should be compact and quiet unless active. The send action may use tangerine, but it should not dominate the screen when disabled or idle.

## Interaction Rules

Motion should help orientation only:

- short hover transitions
- stable selected-state updates
- subtle panel or row changes
- no theatrical page entrances

Hover, focus, selected, loading, and disabled states must not cause layout shift. Fixed-format UI elements need stable dimensions.

Focus states should be visible and tangerine-led, but contained so they do not create clipped halos or stray outlines.

### Focus rings

- **The ring is `outline: 2px solid var(--focus-ring)`.** A zero-specificity `:where(:focus-visible)` rule near the top of `app.css` draws it for any control that has no rule of its own, so a new control only chooses where the ring sits. Ring with `--focus-ring`, not `--accent` or `--accent-bright`: they resolve alike today, but only the token follows a change to the ring.
- **The same rule sets `scroll-margin: 5px`**, the ring's reach plus 1px, so a control that Tab scrolls into view keeps its whole ring. A ring that reaches further needs a larger margin of its own.
- **Offset by how the control sits.** `2px` outset for a standalone control, `1px` for chips, fields, and tight clusters, and `-2px` inset for rows and menu items that touch their neighbours or sit in a clipped list. A control that sits within the ring's reach of its container's edge also takes the inset ring, because an outset ring crosses that edge. The thread card's title band is the example: its cluster, in-title pin, and subthread toggle all ring inset.
- **A tint, halo, fill, or border change may accompany the ring, never replace it.** The tints `app.css` used measured under 3:1 against rest wherever the keyboard walk reached them (WCAG 1.4.11), and several were the same paint as hover.
- **A borderless field puts the ring on its wrapper**, with `:has()` (the composer, the picker and jump palette search rows, the archive filter).
- **An `aria-activedescendant` cursor row takes the ring too**, inset. DOM focus stays in the field, but that row is the one Enter picks, and a hover tint does not tell it apart from a hovered row.
- **Clip with room for the ring.** `overflow: hidden` cuts an outset ring at the box. Use `overflow: clip` plus `overflow-clip-margin` equal to the ring's reach, on both axes: Chromium ignores the margin unless both clip.
- **Opacity dims a ring with its control**, and so do `filter: opacity()` and a `mask`. An `aria-disabled` control that fades trades the fade for a muted paint at full opacity while focused: `--border-subtle`, `--text-subtle`, no fill. A container dimmed only for emphasis, such as an Access Control node off the trace, returns to full opacity while focus is inside it.

### Focus containment

- **Dialogs and menus contain focus through shared hooks.** An `aria-modal` dialog uses `useModalDialog`, and a `role="menu"` popup uses `useMenuNavigation`. [apps/desktop/AGENTS.md](../apps/desktop/AGENTS.md) has the rules under "Modal dialogs and overlays" and "Menus".
- **A full-window layer makes what it covers `inert`.** Settings and Automations cover the sidebar and main, which go inert while either is open, so Tab cannot walk controls nobody can see. The layer takes focus on open, because its opener went inert with them, and draws no ring, since it is not a Tab stop. On close, focus returns to the control that opened it, but only when focus fell to `<body>`: a close that moved focus on purpose, such as a thread taking the composer, keeps it.
- **Something that floats over the app gets out of the way of keyboard focus, and only that** (WCAG 2.4.11). The notice stack sits at the bottom-left over everything, and an error notice stays until dismissed, so when Tab or arrow-key navigation lands on a control the stack hides entirely, the stack moves to the top edge under the chrome band (`toast-stack-placement.ts`). A notice that moves is one the operator reaches for and misses, so nothing short of that moves it: not a partly covered control, not a click (a text field matches `:focus-visible` on click), not a focus the app moves after a click, not paging between notices or a resize, and never while the pointer is over the stack. It stays on the top edge until keyboard focus lands on something the top edge hides, or the last notice closes. It does not claim Escape: that key belongs to the layer stack.

## Tooltips

Two patterns. Pick the right one:

**CSS pseudo-element tooltip** (`tooltip-target` + `data-tooltip` in
`app.css`): cheapest and stateless. Use when the hovered element and
all its ancestors render with `overflow: visible`. The tooltip is an
`::after` pseudo-element positioned absolutely; any clipping ancestor
(`overflow: hidden`, `overflow: auto`, `overflow: scroll`) chops it.

```tsx
<span className="… tooltip-target" data-tooltip={text}>…</span>
```

**Portal-rendered tooltip** (`useViewportTooltip` hook in
`renderer/src/lib/useViewportTooltip.tsx`): when ANY ancestor clips —
sidebar scroll regions, overflow-hidden chips with text-ellipsis,
draggable rails. The hook renders the tooltip via `createPortal` to
`document.body` with `position: fixed`, then clamps to viewport bounds
via `useLayoutEffect` after measuring the rendered text.

```tsx
const { show, hide, tooltipNode } =
  useViewportTooltip({ className: "viewport-tooltip" });
return (
  <span
    onMouseEnter={(e) => show(e.currentTarget, "Multi\nline\ntext")}
    onMouseLeave={hide}
    onFocus={(e) => show(e.currentTarget, "Multi\nline\ntext")}
    onBlur={hide}
  >
    …
    {tooltipNode}
  </span>
);
```

Both honor `\n` for multi-line bodies via `white-space: pre-wrap`.

Anti-pattern: native `title=` attribute. Inconsistent timing across
platforms, can't be styled, no multi-line on macOS Electron.

## Accessibility

Maintain strong contrast between text and surfaces. Critical states should not rely on color alone: pair color with text, shape, placement, iconography, or row treatment.

Long titles, paths, and branch names must truncate or wrap predictably without colliding with timestamps, pills, or controls.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- gray text on darker gray
- saturated slate, navy, or purple-blue dashboard palettes (the opt-in Blue color theme keeps its navy low-saturation)
- purple accents, gradient orbs, and decorative glows
- orange-dominant panels or orange body copy
- browser-default controls
- oversized headings for utility surfaces
- punctuation unread badges such as `!`
- animated tab states that leave a ghost outline
- cards inside cards
- generic implementation narration in UI copy

## Implementation Checklist

Before shipping a visual change:

- update centralized tokens before adding local color values
- verify the change against this document and the desktop style guide
- check selected, hover, focus, disabled, empty, and unread states
- inspect screenshots at desktop and narrow widths when layout changes
- keep E2E or theme-contract coverage current for shared shell behavior
